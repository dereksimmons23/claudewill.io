## THE COURTSHIP

Claude was up in Kansas, working or doing something. His parents still lived in Oklahoma. He bought two registered race horses — one named Bronson, the other Red Bob (or Red Pop). Rode one back, led the other. His father Albert complained about them — not practical, wouldn't help with farming. Claude traded them for two work horses.

Claude brought Hazel Canay to a dance. Saw Mary Ethel Vernon there. She was 14 and a half, maybe 15. He would have been 19 or 20. This was around 1922.

He told Mary he wanted to take her home. She tried to get rid of him. He wouldn't go away. They dated for two years. "Every time I looked around, there he was," Vernie told Burl in the 1985 interview.

## THE MARRIAGE

Claude and Vernie married in 1925. Judge at the Alva courthouse. Claude was 22, Vernie was "2 months short of 17" — so 16.

Clara Belle, their first child, was born approximately 7 months after the wedding. Maybe May 1925.

That first year, Claude worked for his father Albert David Simmons. Went to get half the money from the wheat crop. Albert didn't want to give it to him — something about Claude getting married. Claude said he was going to sue him.

Vernie on Albert: "He never was exactly up on that work. Claude could outwork him and his older brother Archie combined, especially shucking corn."

## THE EARLY YEARS

They moved around quite a bit before getting a place in the Sand Hills south of town. Claude was "doing a little of this, a little of that." (Prohibition era — moonshine possible but unconfirmed.)

Clara Belle was born at Vernie's parents' house, "on 320 acres" (half a section).

Verna Lee was born in Wichita. They went up to Kansas in September so Claude could work (possibly railroad work), and came back in December. This was around 1929 — right when the Depression hit.

They lost Albert, their first son, that year (1929). Albert Aldrich Simmons, named after Claude's father. Died around age 2 from food poisoning. The Wichita trip may have been connected — before or because of losing Albert.

Nettie Mae was born "on the little place."

## NOTES

- Vernie's 1985 interview is the primary source. 117 minutes, recorded with Burl. No breaks.
- Vernie's memory of dates, doctors, home births, and places was extraordinary for someone who was 77 in 1985.
- "Needed marriage certificate to get railroad retirement" — worth investigating. Claude must have worked railroad at some point (possibly the Wichita trip, 1929).
- One of the kids was born in Wichita — confirmed as Verna Lee.
- The interview tape exists somewhere. Finding it would be significant.
