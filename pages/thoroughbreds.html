        <h1>You Come From The Blood Of Thoroughbreds</h1>
        <p class="subtitle">A family history</p>
        
        <h2>Prologue</h2>
        
        <p>I don't remember how old I was when he said it. I don't remember what stretch of asphalt we were on or what Queen song was playing from a cassette in a small domestic truck or a foreign sedan. I do remember the words, but more importantly, I've been studying them since. Grappling to understand how seven words would go from his lips to a giant tattoo on my back. "You Come From The Blood Of Thoroughbreds." I didn't laugh. I didn't ask questions. But I did value it maybe more than any other words that have been said to me, from classrooms to basketball gyms and even board rooms. Because he said it like he knew it was true. He had a way of doing that.</p>
        
        <hr>
        
        <h2>Part One: Plain Salt</h2>
        
        <h3>Chapter 1: The Country Queen</h3>
        
        <p>In May of 1985, my grandmother sat in her living room with a little black poodle named Pepper beside her and proceeded to recite seventy-six years of family history like she was reading from a book nobody else could see.</p>
        
        <p>Names, dates, marriages, births, deaths. All of it filed with perfect precision in her mind. No coffee breaks. Not even a glass of water. 117 minutes of priceless footage that defies the last 40 years of tech development.</p>
        
        <p>Her full name was Mary Ethel Vernon Simmons. Vernie, as everyone called her. "Nicknames start in your own house," she told Uncle Burl, who was smart enough to record the conversation.</p>
        
        <p>An hour into the interview, she asks Burl if he wants her to name all of the grandkids and their birthdays. It wasn't a question. It was a declaration.</p>
        
        <p>Imagine being Vernie at fourteen, meeting a persistent young man named Claude at a dance. "Every time I looked around, there he was," she told Burl, with the kind of sigh that spans decades. She tried to get rid of him, she insisted, but he wouldn't go away. They got married at the Alva courthouse when Vernie was "a few months shy of 17" and Claude was 22. They weren't in high school or college because they both finished school after 8th grade. Different times.</p>
        
        <p>What followed was a life that could break most people: Eleven children in twenty-five years, dust bowls, depressions, endless work. When someone once told her she had too many mouths to feed, Vernie had a swift reply about the woman making "watery gravy" — an insult that carried weight in a time when stretching what you had meant the difference between hunger and satisfaction.</p>
        
        <p>I was twelve when this interview was recorded. Before I would turn thirteen, she would no longer be with us. She died on Christmas Eve that year.</p>
        
        <h3>Chapter 2: The Race Horses</h3>
        
        <p>Somewhere in Kansas, around 1922, my grandfather Claude bought two race horses. One was named Bronson, the other Red Bob (or maybe Red Pop — family stories get fuzzy around the edges). He rode one horse and led the other all the way back to Oklahoma.</p>
        
        <p>I try to picture this moment: A young man not yet twenty, astride one racing thoroughbred while guiding another, making his way south across open country. What was he thinking about? The races he'd win? The money he'd make? Or maybe just the pure joy of owning two fine horses?</p>
        
        <p>His father Albert wasn't impressed. Race horses weren't practical. They weren't work horses. They wouldn't help with the farming that needed to be done.</p>
        
        <p>So Claude traded them. Gave up his racing dreams for a pair of solid work horses that would pull plows and help bring in harvests. It's the kind of story that could sound like defeat — young man's dreams crushed by practical reality. But I don't think that's what it was at all.</p>
        
        <blockquote>Some people might say he chose practical over possible. Responsibility over dreams. But I'm not so sure. Maybe he just understood something about thoroughbreds that took me years to figure out: It's not about the racing. It's about what you're willing to carry, and how far you'll go to get where you need to be.</blockquote>
        
        <h3>Chapter 3: Territory Born</h3>
        
        <p>Claude William Simmons was born in 1903 in Oklahoma Territory. Not a state yet — that wouldn't happen until 1907. Born in a place that was still defining itself, still becoming.</p>
        
        <p>That seems important somehow. To come into the world in a territory rather than a state. To take your first breaths in a place without firm boundaries, without the settled weight of established order. Perhaps that shapes a person differently. Perhaps it makes you more comfortable with the unsettled, the becoming.</p>
        
        <hr>
        
        <h2>Part Two: Moving South</h2>
        
        <h3>Chapter 4: Charlton at Thirteen</h3>
        
        <p>Charlton Jackson Simmons, one of the pioneers of Green County, Wisconsin, was a native of North Carolina. Born in Greene County, June 1, 1819. When he was thirteen years old, his parents emigrated to Illinois. His father bought land and commenced to improve a farm, but he died in April, 1834. The following February, Mrs. Simmons also died, leaving seven children, the subject of this sketch being the eldest, and upon him devolved the care of the family.</p>
        
        <p>Soon after his mother's death, the farm and stock were disposed of in such a manner that the children realized but $10 each from the proceeds.</p>
        
        <p>How does a thirteen-year-old boy take on the care of six siblings?</p>
        
        <p>I think about Charlton sometimes when I feel overwhelmed with responsibility. A thirteen-year-old carrying what most grown men couldn't.</p>
        
        <p>By 1882, Charlton's farm contained 1,100 acres. He had fourteen children. From $10 as an orphaned thirteen-year-old to 1,100 acres. This isn't a rags to riches story — it's too real, too gritty for that. It's a story about persistence, about putting one foot in front of the other day after day, year after year, decade after decade.</p>
        
        <hr>
        
        <h2>Part Three: The Weight</h2>
        
        <h3>Chapter 6: Morning Cuffs</h3>
        
        <p>The morning Claude died, his arthritis was so bad he had trouble buttoning the cuffs of his long-sleeved shirt. It was August in Oklahoma, 1967. A man with less pride might have rolled up his sleeves, might have conceded to the heat. Claude buttoned his cuffs.</p>
        
        <p>My grandmother walked around the side of his pickup to say goodbye, and found him on the ground. Massive heart attack. My father was 18 and got married three months later.</p>
        
        <p>I've thought about those buttoned cuffs often. The simple dignity of doing things properly, regardless of difficulty or discomfort. The refusal to concede, to take the easier path. This despite the fact that Claude had worked full time since he was 13 years old. Fifty-one years of labor.</p>
        
        <blockquote>Would I have the strength to button my cuffs with arthritic hands in August heat? I don't know. But I carry the image with me, a reminder of what it means to come from the blood of thoroughbreds.</blockquote>
        
        <h3>Chapter 7: Working at Thirteen</h3>
        
        <p>Claude started working full time at 13, just like Charlton had. Not because his parents died — Albert and his wife were still alive — but because that's what boys did in that time and place. Education wasn't the priority. Work was.</p>
        
        <p>Eighth grade. That was it. No high school diploma. No college degree. Just the education of fields and barns and endless days of physical labor.</p>
        
        <p>By the time Claude was my age, he'd already been working for 39 years. By the time he died, it was 51 years of full-time labor.</p>
        
        <p>What I do know is that he could outwork his father. That's a detail that survived — Claude could outwork Albert and his older brother Archie combined, especially shucking corn. There's pride in that statement, the kind of pride that comes from measuring yourself against others through physical labor, through tangible results.</p>
        
        <hr>
        
        <h2>Looking Forward, Looking Back</h2>
        
        <h3>What Do Thoroughbreds Know?</h3>
        
        <p>When my father told me I came from the blood of thoroughbreds, what exactly did he mean? What qualities was he attributing to our family line?</p>
        
        <p>Was it work ethic? The capacity to outwork others, to persist, to endure?</p>
        
        <p>Was it adaptability? The ability to change with circumstances, to shift from farming to railroads, from Wisconsin to Oklahoma?</p>
        
        <p>Was it some combination of pride and practicality? The impulse to buy race horses coupled with the wisdom to trade them for work horses when necessary?</p>
        
        <p>Or was it something else entirely? Something passed down through blood and bone and example rather than through explicit lessons?</p>
        
        <p>I don't know. I can't know. But I carry the phrase with me, literally marked on my body, a reminder of both the gift and the burden of such a legacy.</p>
        
        <blockquote>"You Come From The Blood Of Thoroughbreds." Simple words, yet infinitely complex in their implications, their expectations, their promise.</blockquote>
        
        <h3>Okay, Great, Now What?</h3>
        
        <p>The thoroughbred blood runs through ideas, through values, through choices, through connections. It manifests in how I coach, how I write, how I parent, how I live. It's in the standards I maintain, the work I do, the way I face challenges, the way I adapt to changes.</p>
        
        <p>Now I build. Not necessarily physical structures on specific pieces of land, but frameworks, platforms, spaces where connection can happen, where stories can be shared, where legacy can be honored.</p>
        
        <p>The blood of thoroughbreds isn't about winning races. It's about knowing which races are worth running. It's about carrying what matters, letting go of what doesn't, and recognizing the difference between the two.</p>
        
        <p>Claude knew this when he traded race horses for work horses. It wasn't about giving up dreams; it was about choosing the right dreams, the ones that would sustain rather than merely excite.</p>
        
        <p>So... okay, great, now what?</p>
        
        <p>Now I button my cuffs, metaphorically speaking. I do what needs doing. I maintain standards. I persevere. I adapt. I work. I build. I connect. I share. I teach. I learn.</p>
        
        <p>I come from the blood of thoroughbreds. I always have. I always will.</p>
        
        <p>The question isn't what that means. The question is what I do with that knowledge.</p>
        
        <p>The answer begins anew each morning.</p>
