# Claude Will Site Pages

This directory contains the HTML pages that make up the public-facing site for Claude Will. These are rendered directly by the browser and should not be confused with the Markdown documentation in `/docs`.

- Use `/docs` for all project documentation, policies, and plans.
- Use `/archived` for historical or reference material.

**Do not add new documentation Markdown files here.**
