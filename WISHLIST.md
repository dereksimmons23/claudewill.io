# CW Wishlist

Future features and improvements. Not promises - just ideas worth exploring.

---

## Features

### Family Mode
A richer mode for family members who want to talk to grandpa about family history. Would include:
- More detailed family stories and genealogy
- Migration history (North Carolina → Illinois → Wisconsin → Kansas → Oklahoma)
- Names and details of the 11 children
- Vernie's stories (she was the family historian)

**Why it's on hold:** Requires careful curation of family facts to avoid hallucination. May want Vernie as a separate agent for family history.

### Voice Interface
Let people talk to CW instead of typing. Would feel more like a real conversation.

### Session Memory
Remember returning visitors across sessions. "Good to see you again."

### Inline Contact Form
When someone asks to contact Derek, CW renders a contact form directly in the chat instead of linking away. User fills it out without leaving the conversation. More seamless, keeps the threshold metaphor intact.

## Improvements

### Smarter Hallucination Prevention
Current approach redirects unknown family questions. Could be more graceful - acknowledge what's known, redirect what isn't.

### Sonnet Upgrade Path
Evaluate whether Haiku quality is sufficient for launch. Sonnet costs 15x more but follows instructions better.

### Analytics Dashboard
Visual dashboard for conversation insights instead of raw SQL queries.

---

## Experiments

### The CW Standard as Framework
Package the five principles into a reusable framework for other AI implementations.

### Multi-Agent Family
CW for practical advice. Vernie for family history. Others TBD.
