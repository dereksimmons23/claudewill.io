## About the Project

Claude Will is named in honor of Claude William Simmons, whose practical wisdom inspired The CW Standard framework. The site serves as both a portfolio for Derek Simmons and a demonstration of cross-domain pattern recognition principles. It is also a testbed for evolving frameworks and future AI agent/assistant concepts.

## Features

- **Conversational Interface**: Ask Claude Will about concepts like The CW Standard, Media Franchise Model, or pattern recognition
- **Cross-Domain Insights**: Explore connections between coaching philosophy, media transformation, and technological implementation
- **Light/Dark Mode**: Toggle between themes based on your preference
- **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly across all device sizes
- **Unified Documentation Hub**: All project, policy, and technical docs are now accessible from `/documentation.html` for clarity and ease of use
- **Modern Navigation**: Main nav includes Home, About Derek, Projects, Resume, Documentation; footer includes Documentation, About Derek, Privacy Policy, Terms of Use

## Key Frameworks

### The CW Standard

A comprehensive framework for navigating complex transitions that bridges human wisdom with technological advancement. The CW Standard emerged from observing how practical wisdom creates patterns of success across seemingly unrelated areas.

### Media Franchise Model

A revolutionary approach to content development that treats traditional verticals as entrepreneurial business units with their own identity and development pathway. This approach generated over $10M in new revenue by creating sponsorship opportunities that transcended traditional platform boundaries.

### Baton Handoff & Pattern Recognition

Frameworks for managing transitions and identifying cross-domain patterns, with detailed documentation in the [Documentation Hub](./documentation.html).
