# Claude Will

Claude Will is a conversational interface that explores connections between coaching philosophy, media transformation, and technological advancement – where pattern recognition reveals insights others miss.

## About the Project

Claude Will is named in honor of Claude William Simmons, whose practical wisdom inspired The CW Standard framework. The site serves as both a portfolio for Derek Simmons and a demonstration of cross-domain pattern recognition principles.

The conversational interface helps users discover meaningful connections between seemingly unrelated domains, creating new insights and possibilities.

## Features
