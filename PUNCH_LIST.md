## Session Notes

### May 13, 2025 Debug Session

We identified several issues with the chat functionality:

1. JavaScript was using `classList.add('claude thinking-message')` with spaces in tokens, which caused DOMTokenList errors
2. CSS selectors (`.user.message`) didn't match JavaScript class assignments (`user-message`)
3. GitHub Actions workflow was failing on a11y checks due to Chrome sandbox issues

We've made changes to address these issues, but the chat functionality is still not working properly on the live site. We'll need to continue debugging after the deployment cycle completes.

### Next Steps

1. Monitor GitHub Actions to ensure successful deployment
2. Verify CSS changes are applied correctly on the live site
3. Do a comprehensive browser console check for any remaining errors
4. Consider a local development environment for faster iteration
5. If issues persist, consider a complete rewrite of the chat functionality
