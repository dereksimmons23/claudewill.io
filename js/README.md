# JavaScript Directory Overview

This directory contains the core JavaScript files powering the interactive and conversational features of the Claude Will site.

## Files

- **chat.js**: Implements the main conversational interface logic, including user input handling, message rendering, and response generation. Designed for modularity and maintainability.
- **main.js**: (If present) Used for general site-wide JavaScript functionality not specific to the chat interface.

## Best Practices

- All JavaScript is written in vanilla JS for maximum compatibility and performance.
- Code is modularized where possible for clarity and maintainability.
- Error handling and input validation are prioritized.
- Comments and documentation are included to aid future development and onboarding.

## Planned Improvements

See [PUNCH_LIST.md](../PUNCH_LIST.md) and [BATON_HANDOFF.md](../BATON_HANDOFF.md) for ongoing and planned JavaScript enhancements, including:
- Refactoring for modularity
- Improved error handling
- Performance optimizations
- Enhanced documentation
