## Architecture Philosophy

This structure demonstrates **The CW Standard** approach to AI development:

1. **Production-Ready Core** - Clean, functional systems that work
2. **Research Archive** - Experimental systems showing R&D process
3. **Clear Separation** - Production vs. research clearly delineated
4. **Portfolio Showcase** - Code as demonstration of capabilities

## From Prototype to Product

The experimental systems in `/research/` represent the conceptual foundation that evolved into [FloShake.io](https://floshake.io) - showing the complete journey from prototype to production-ready AI framework.

## Technical Standards

- **Vanilla JavaScript** for maximum compatibility and performance
- **Modular design** for clarity and maintainability
- **Error handling** and input validation prioritized
- **Comprehensive documentation** for team collaboration
- **Human-AI orchestration** principles demonstrated throughout

## Contributing

This codebase serves as both functional infrastructure and portfolio demonstration. When contributing:

1. Keep production files focused and clean
2. Document experimental concepts thoroughly
3. Maintain clear separation between core and research
4. Follow established patterns for consistency

## Integration with FloShake

The research systems here demonstrate concepts implemented in production at [FloShake.io](https://floshake.io):
- Quantum state content models
- Flow protection frameworks
- Serendipity engines
- Agentic RAG architectures

This showcases the complete R&D to production pipeline that defines The CW Standard approach to AI development.
