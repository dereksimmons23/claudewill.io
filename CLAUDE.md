# CLAUDE.md — claudewill.io

**Last updated:** February 24, 2026
**Status:** v2.4 — Three Rooms Architecture + Kitchen Narrative
**Milestone:** Site architecture sweep, Kitchen v2, nav simplified, dead pages killed, pitch deck updated

> Pull up a chair. He's listening.

> The prompt is the product. The product is the proof. The proof is the passenger.

## Current State

### What Works
- **Homepage** — 3-screen billboard: porch light (gold asterisk easter egg → opens porch), claudewill wordmark, Derek's welcome intro, "claude will ___" typewriter (listen first, speak directly, find a way, keep going). Screen 2: Derek intro. Screen 3: the standard (5 clickable principles). Porch widget + menu trigger hidden on screen 1 via IntersectionObserver, appear on scroll.
- **The Workshop** — /workshop: THE conversion page. Full-screen slide deck (8 slides): problem, standard, method, proof, derek, two ways in, assessment form. Arrow keys, swipe, click navigation. Print-as-PDF. Uses shared js/deck.js engine. /work-with-me redirects here.
- **Porch widget** — `cw> _` terminal trigger on every page including homepage. Slide-up chat panel connects to CW API. Vernie Mode via "family?" chip or `?family=true` URL parameter.
- **Command palette** — Terminal-style nav overlay with 3 items: the story, the kitchen, derek. /work-with-me is a CTA destination, not a nav item. Triggered by `menu` in sticky headers or floating `menu` button on other pages.
- **Story page** — Full narrative at /story (4 chapters, lineage, photo)
- **CW Remembers** — Visitor memory. UUID token in localStorage, Supabase `visitors` + `visitor_notes` tables. Returning visitors get context injected into CW's prompt (name, visit count, past conversation summaries, recurring tags). Session summarized by Haiku on tab close. Name detected and stored automatically. Porch mode only.
- **Supabase logging** — Conversations stored in `conversations` table
- **Multilingual** — CW responds in user's language
- **Safety** — Bot protection, crisis resources, inline disclosure
- **Accessibility** — WCAG 2.1 AA compliant
- **Hallucination guardrails** — CW won't fabricate research/sources, admits limitations
- **Site knowledge** — CW knows about /story, /kitchen, /derek, /work-with-me, /derek/research, /arcade
- **Size This Up** — Guided 5-step problem-sizing flow (Define → Weight → Resources → Focus → Next Step)
- **Constitutional thinking** — CW knows 5 constitutional frameworks (CW Standard, Anthropic, Declaration, US Constitution, others) and can help people think constitutionally
- **Political topics** — CW distinguishes partisan fights (avoids) from constitutional principles (engages directly); can name constitutional violations without being partisan
- **Family knowledge** — CW knows Derek's siblings, Albert (first child, died young), CW Jr and his descendants
- **The Trade** — Guided reflection for people carrying traded dreams (not therapy — guided conversation with guardrails)
- **Referral intelligence** — CW points people to the right resources conversationally (mental health, legal, medical, research, career, financial)
- **Liberation Gravy** — Guided flow for thinning out subscriptions/consumption (Inventory → Gut Check → Milk vs Water → Cut → Add-Back), includes crop rotation frame (subscribe/use/cancel/rotate) and sharecropping trap warning
- **The Funnel Cake** — What "free" actually costs (data, email, attention, peace) + the cancellation gauntlet (guilt, discount, bundle, maze)
- **The Kitchen** — Public page at /kitchen. TUI terminal aesthetic with pixel art potbelly stove header, collapsible sections, sparklines, status dots, tree connectors. Reads from kitchen-data.json (generated by overnight agents via GitHub Actions at 5 AM CST). Light/dark mode. CTA → /workshop.
- **Overnight Agents** — GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/overnight-agents.yml`) runs 4 agents nightly: site audit, Gemini industry brief (Google Search grounded), Perplexity research brief, Mistral code review. Reports compiled into kitchen-data.json and committed by bot. API keys in GitHub secrets.
- **Model routing** — Porch→Haiku, Vernie→Haiku. Smart routing in cw.js.
- **CW Link Renderer** — CW chat responses render clickable links (markdown + bare URLs) on all pages.
- **Dark mode** — `prefers-color-scheme: dark` override in shared-nav.css. One `body`-level media query overrides all page variables. All 15 pages get dark mode automatically. Kitchen already dark — no conflict.
- **Mobile polish** — Porch panel full-screen takeover on mobile (≤700px). Header shows `claudewill*` static (no hover animation on touch). Chip/CTA wrapping fixed. Close button enlarged for touch targets.
- **Homepage energy** — Scroll reveals (IntersectionObserver, fade up with staggered delays), gold gradient dividers, ambient radial glow from porch light, CTAs with gold border + glow hover. Respects prefers-reduced-motion.
- **Readability** — Body copy 1rem across all reading pages. Mobile base 16px (no shrink). Nothing below 0.75rem. Content density tuned on derek + story pages (more breathing room between paragraphs/sections).

### What's Experimental
- "Size This Up" tool (gathering feedback)
- "The Trade" tool (new, gathering feedback)
- "Liberation Gravy" tool (new, gathering feedback)

## Architecture

### Stack
| Component | Technology | Notes |
|-----------|------------|-------|
| Frontend | Static HTML/CSS/JS | No framework, vanilla JS |
| Hosting | Netlify | Auto-deploys from main branch |
| API | Netlify Functions | Serverless, cw.js handles all requests |
| AI | Anthropic Haiku | claude-haiku-4-5 for Porch/Vernie conversations |
| AI | Anthropic Opus | claude-opus-4-20250514 for Kitchen conversations |
| Database | Supabase | PostgreSQL, free tier |
| Development | Claude Code (Opus) | This conversation |

### Why These Choices
- **Haiku for conversations** — Fast, cheap (~$3-5/month at scale), good enough for CW's voice
- **Opus for building** — Complex reasoning, architecture decisions, code quality
- **No framework** — Simplicity, fast load times, no build step
- **Netlify** — Free tier, automatic deploys, serverless functions included

**Deleted pages:** proof.html, strategies.html, mirae.html (folded into /derek), the-cw-standard.html (content at /story#the-cw-standard). studio.html renamed to workshop.html. All have 301 redirects in netlify.toml. **Dead pages:** library→derek, derek/assessment→work-with-me, stable/studio→workshop. **Live pages formerly dead:** /workshop (now slide deck), /map (site index).

**Note:** LinkedIn content, publishing workflows, and TRACKER.md live in `~/Desktop/writing/`. Client deliverables live in `~/Desktop/clients/cascadia/`. CW Method docs moved to `~/Desktop/standard-intelligence/method/`. This repo is the product — claudewill, business presence, prompt system.

---

## Prompt Architecture

System prompt is modular — broken into composable .md files in `netlify/functions/cw-prompt/`:
- **persona.md** — Identity, voice, backstory, THE WILL
- **family.md** — Family stories, Vernie interview data, genealogy
- **cw-standard.md** — The 5 principles
- **derek.md** — About Derek, methodology, CW Strategies
- **behaviors.md** — How CW operates (instinct, not checklist)
- **site-knowledge.md** — Site pages, navigation awareness
- **tools/** — Size This Up, Recalibrate, The Trade, Liberation Gravy, The Funnel Cake
- **guardrails/** — Safety, hallucination prevention, political topics, referrals

Compiled at build time via `node scripts/compile-prompt.js` → `compiled-prompt.js` (gitignored, regenerated on deploy).

Current size: ~45.6K chars, ~11.6K input tokens.

## Key Files

| File | What It Does | Gotchas |
|------|--------------|---------|
| `netlify/functions/cw.js` | API handler + Anthropic call | Imports prompt from cw-prompt/ |
| `netlify/functions/cw-prompt/*.md` | CW's personality (modular) | **Edit these, then compile** |
| `netlify/functions/cw-prompt/index.js` | Prompt assembler | Tries compiled first, falls back to dynamic |
| `scripts/compile-prompt.js` | Build step — compiles .md to JS | **Run after any prompt edit** |
| `index.html` | 4-screen billboard homepage | Typewriter JS inline, no chat code |
| `story.html` | The Story page | Progress bar, print styles |
| `js/shared-nav.js` | Command palette overlay | NAV_CONFIG defines all nav items |
| `js/porch-widget.js` | CW chat widget | Connects to /.netlify/functions/cw, on every page |
| `css/shared-nav.css` | Palette + footer + dark mode + mobile header | Dark mode override, mobile static header, .footer-note, .hw |
| `css/porch-widget.css` | Chat panel styles | Terminal trigger + slide-up panel |
| `netlify/functions/kitchen-data.js` | Kitchen dashboard data aggregator | Auth-gated, fetches from CW Brief worker + Supabase |
| `js/cw-link-renderer.js` | Renders clickable links in CW messages | Loaded before porch-widget.js on all pages |
| `HANDOFF.md` | Session state for /standup | **Updated by /eod** |

## Known Gotchas

### System Prompt Location
CW's personality is modularized in `netlify/functions/cw-prompt/` — persona.md, family.md, derek.md, behaviors.md, tools/, guardrails/, etc. The assembler is `index.js` which tries a pre-compiled version first (for Netlify deploy) and falls back to dynamic file reading (local dev). Run `node scripts/compile-prompt.js` after editing any prompt .md file — this generates `compiled-prompt.js` which esbuild can bundle. **If you skip this step, CW will respond as generic Claude in production.**

### Haiku vs Opus
- **Haiku** — Runs in production for user conversations (fast, cheap)
- **Opus** — Used in Claude Code for building (this conversation)
- Don't mix them up. Haiku can't do complex architecture. Opus is overkill for chat.

### docs/ Folder
`docs/drafts/` and `docs/reference/` are gitignored — working content stays local. LinkedIn content and all publishing workflows moved to `~/Desktop/writing/` (Feb 12, 2026).

### Family Details
CW hallucinated family details early on. Now the system prompt has strict guardrails. If someone reports hallucinations, check the system prompt section on family.

### Kitchen Data Pipeline
Overnight agents (GitHub Actions, 5 AM CST) → markdown reports → compile step → kitchen-data.json → committed to repo → Netlify deploys → Kitchen page reads JSON. Scripts in `scripts/overnight/*.mjs`. If Kitchen shows stale data, check the workflow run at GitHub Actions. If site audit shows false flags, it probably ran during a Netlify deploy (transient — clears on next scheduled run).

### Model Routing
cw.js routes models: Porch → Haiku (claude-haiku-4-5, 500 tokens), Vernie → Haiku (500 tokens).

### Porch Widget + Command Palette Z-Index
Widget button: 9997. Chat panel: 9998. Command palette: 10000. When palette opens, widget hides. Escape closes both.

---

## Session Continuity

### Conversation Storage
Claude Code stores conversations at:
```
~/.claude/projects/-Users-dereksimmons-Desktop-claudewill.io/
```

### Starting a Session
```bash
cw porch
```

**First thing every session:** Run `/standup` — it reads HANDOFF.md, checks CW health, surfaces priorities, and asks what we're working on.

### The Session
```
Open
├── /standup — read HANDOFF.md, check CW health, surface priorities
│
Work
├── /tracker view — check open items
├── /status — cross-area health check
├── /meeting [file] — process notes into structured summary
│
Close
├── /eod — update HANDOFF.md + hygiene + tomorrow's priorities
```

Skills live in `.claude/skills/`:
| Skill | What it does |
|-------|-------------|
| `/standup` | Morning opener — status, priorities, CW health |
| `/eod` | End of session — updates HANDOFF.md, hygiene, tomorrow's priorities |
| `/status` | Cross-area status check (prompt, pages, infra, subdomains) |
| `/tracker` | Feature/work tracking (view, add, update) |
| `/housekeeping` | Repo hygiene — loose files, stale dates, prompt integrity |
| `/meeting` | Process transcript/notes into structured summary |
| `/recalibrate` | 7-question framework for any subject at a crossroads |
| `/brief` | Morning analytics — conversations, content calendar, CW health |

### Resuming Context
If context runs out, start fresh — `/standup` picks up from HANDOFF.md automatically.

---

## Style Guide

### Writing
- **AP Style** — Numerals 10+, no Oxford comma, $10 not "10 dollars"
- **Third-person** — For public content ("Derek built this" not "I built this")
- **Direct voice** — Short sentences. No filler. Like CW would talk.

### Typography
- **IBM Plex Mono** — Primary font everywhere (brand, nav, body, code)
- **Monospace** — All text is monospace. Terminal aesthetic.

### Colors (Light Theme)
- **Background:** #fafaf8 (warm white)
- **Text:** #0a1628 (midnight blue)
- **Accent:** #d4a84b (gold)
- **Link:** #4a8ec2 (blue)
- **Dim:** #6b7280 (gray)
- **Border:** #e5e7eb

---

## Supabase

### Tables
- **conversations** — Main logging table (timestamp, user_message, cw_response, condition, session_id, ip_hash, token_usage)

### Useful Queries
See `ANALYTICS_QUERIES.md` for 15+ SQL queries covering:
- Daily/weekly conversation counts
- Token usage analysis
- Session patterns
- Condition distribution

### Access
```bash
# Supabase dashboard
https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/[project-id]
```

Environment variables in Netlify:
- `SUPABASE_URL`
- `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`

### Separate Build: Constitutional Layer
A framework for AI agent reasoning about rules, trust, systems, and coordination. Shares principles with CW Standard but different interface — no persona, built for agent-to-agent use. CW's Porch stays simple (grandfather helping neighbors); the constitutional layer handles the infrastructure question of how AI agents should reason about:
- What rules am I actually following?
- Who benefits when those rules are followed or broken?
- Trust to do what? (domain-specific trust assessment)
- What do I do when the system fails?

Not a chatbot. An API or framework. Anthropic's constitution covers Claude; this would cover coordination between agents built on various models. Early concept — needs architecture work.

---

## Vision

### The Porch Metaphor
CW's Porch is a place to sit and talk. You show up with a problem. CW listens, asks questions, gives you a straight answer or points you elsewhere. No judgment. No performance. Just help.

### Human Agency + AI
The domain isn't just a name. claudewill.io — Claude's will. Human determination carried forward through an AI that happens to share his first name. The builder's work continues through technology, not despite it.

### The CW Standard
Five principles that guide everything:
1. Truth over comfort
2. Usefulness over purity
3. Transparency over reputation
4. People over systems
5. Agency over ideology

### February 22, 2026 — Mobile Polish + Dark Mode + Readability
- **Mobile fixes** — Porch full-screen takeover (inset: 0, 100% width/height, ≤700px breakpoint). Header `claudewill*` shown static on mobile (no hover on touch). Chip `white-space: nowrap` + smaller size. Derek CTAs stack vertically on mobile. Close button enlarged.
- **Dark mode** — `prefers-color-scheme: dark` override in shared-nav.css on `body` (not `:root` — inline styles would override). All 15 pages. `--card-bg: #0f1f3a` for card-based pages. Kitchen already dark — no conflict.
- **Homepage energy** — Scroll reveals (IntersectionObserver, `.reveal` class, staggered delays). Gold gradient dividers (`border-image`). Ambient glow (`radial-gradient` from porch light). CTAs restyled with gold border + glow hover. Respects `prefers-reduced-motion`.
- **Content density** — Homepage intro 30 words → 12. Derek bio paragraph → 3 scannable `<li>` items. derek.html paragraph spacing 0.75rem → 1.25rem, section spacing 2.5rem → 3rem. story.html paragraph spacing 1.25rem → 1.5rem, lineage/standard items wider.
- **Font sizes** — Body copy 0.95rem → 1rem on all reading pages (index, derek, story, work-with-me, workshop, library, map). Mobile base stays 16px (was dropping to 15px). Porch chat 0.85rem → 0.9rem. Nothing below 0.75rem anywhere.
- **7 commits:** b9e6ba3e, 3fbfbe9a, 427e1b1a, 593102fb, 0853da02, 79ab365f, + earlier session

### February 22, 2026 — CW Remembers + Homepage Redesign
- **CW Remembers** — Visitor identity and memory system. UUID visitor token, Supabase tables (visitors, visitor_notes), session summarization via Haiku, name detection, returning visitor context injected into CW's system prompt. Memory behavior in behaviors.md. Porch mode only.
- **Homepage screens 2-3** — Screen 2: derek label, question headline, typewriter credentials, short bio, two CTAs. Screen 3: the standard label, headline, five principles, "the full story" link. Removed quote, decorative star, and "keep going" signoff. All lowercase.

### February 22, 2026 — The Funnel + Homepage Screen 1
- **Homepage screen 1 redesign** — Porch light (48px gold asterisk with glow, easter egg → opens porch widget), stacked claudewill wordmark, Derek's welcome intro, "claude will ___" typewriter (listen first, speak directly, find a way, keep going). 85vh so screen 2 peeks. Porch widget + floating menu trigger hidden on screen 1 via IntersectionObserver.
- **Global header fix** — Simplified menu trigger: removed asterisk from all 8 page headers, just says "menu" in dim gray. Fixed `cw*` → `claudewill*` hover animation pushing center content (`min-width: 12ch`). Consistent styling hierarchy: bold brand left, 600-weight page title center, dim gray menu right.
- **Work With Me** — /work-with-me: THE conversion page. Pitch → proof → assessment form. One page, full funnel.
- **Nav simplified** — 4 sections with subsections → 3 flat links: derek, the story, work with me.
- **Derek page trimmed** — Removed engagement pitch, recommendations, what I build. Kept bio, little star, dispatches, contact. First button now "work with me →".
- **CW knows /work-with-me** — site-knowledge.md updated, prompt recompiled. CW points potential clients to /work-with-me.

### February 22, 2026 — The Kitchen + HANDOFF Items
