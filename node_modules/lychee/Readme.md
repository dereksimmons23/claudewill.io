# Lychee

One interface. Many databases. For Node.js.

# Installation

```npm install lychee```

# Usage

## Model definition

```coffee-script
Lychee = require 'lychee'

Lychee.connect ['mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/posts']

class Post extends Lychee.Model
	@driver 'mongodb'
	@key '_id', primary: yes
	@key 'title', default: 'Default title'
	@key 'body', default: 'Default body'
	
	@collection 'my_posts' # optional
	
	@timestamps create: 'created_at', update: 'updated_at' # optional. created_at and updated_at are default values

Post = Lychee.setup Post
```

Supported databases:

- MongoDB
- REST (requests RESTful remote resource via HTTP, see next)


**Note**: only one key can be primary

## Finding records

```coffee-script
Post.find (err, posts) -> # finding all posts

Post.find title: 'Nice post', (err, posts) -> # finding posts with title = "Nice Post"

Post.find sort: id: 1, (err, posts) -> # finding all posts and sorting them by id(asc)

Post.find title: 'Nice post', sort: id: 1, (err, posts) -> # combined previous two
```

## Creating records

```coffee-script
post = new Post
post.title = 'Post title'
post.body = 'Post body'
post.save ->
	# post saved
```

## Updating records

```coffee-script
Post.find (err, posts) ->
	post = posts[0]
	post.title = 'Updated post title'
	post.save ->
		# post updated
```

## Removing records

```coffee-script
Post.find (err, posts) ->
	post = posts[0]
	post.remove ->
		# post removed

Post.remove -> # remove all posts
```

## Validation

Check out tests for now, complete guide will be written soon.

## Events

```coffee-script
Post.on 'create', ->
	@title # access model's fields just like this
```

Available events: create, update, save, remove, removeAll.

## Hooks

```coffee-script
class Post extends Lychee.Model
	# driver and keys declaration
	
	beforeSave: ->
		@title # you can access fields here, too
```

Available hooks:

- before: create, update, save, remove
- after: create, update, save, remove
- around: create, update, save, remove

## Scopes

```coffee-script
class Post extends Lychee.Model
	# driver and keys declaration
	
	@scope 'latest', limit: 1, sort: _id: -1 # params that will be passed to Post#find

Post = Lychee.setup Post
Post.latest (err, posts) ->
	posts.length is 1
```

# Drivers

## MongoDB

That's the minimum you need to define a model that talks to MongoDB database.

```coffee-script
class Post extends Lychee.Model
	@driver 'mongodb'
	@key '_id', primary: yes
```

## REST

That's the minimum you need to define a model that talks to RESTful resource.

```coffee-script
class Post extends Lychee.Model
	@driver 'rest'
	@url 'http://api.google.com' # No trailing slash!
	
	parse: (response) -> # you can override default parse method, optional
		JSON.parse response
```

## Your own

To make your own driver you have to implement class with such methods:

```coffee-script
class MyDriver
	constructor: (model) -> # actual model passed here
	
	find: (options, done) ->
	
	create: (fields, done) ->
	
	update: (fields, done) ->
	
	remove: (fields, done) ->
	
	removeAll: (done) ->
	
	@connect: (hosts, done) -> # array of hosts, like ['myDriver://127.0.0.1/woot']
	
	@disconnect: (done) ->	
```

and register it:

```coffee-script
Lychee.registerDriver 'myDriver', MyDriver
```

That's it!

**Notice**: Docs will be ready soon.

# Roadmap

- Add Redis driver
- Add cache support

# Testing
