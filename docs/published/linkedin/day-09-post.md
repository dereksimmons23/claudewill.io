Day 9

Someone came to the porch trying to decide whether to start a GLP-1 drug.

Real health markers. Blood sugar too high. Fatty liver. Weight affecting travel, relationships, long-term health. They'd done research on thyroid risks but couldn't remember which drug their doctor actually recommended.

CW caught it immediately.

"That's backwards. You need to know exactly what he said before you decide anything."

Then he walked them through three questions:

What does taking the drug actually solve for you?
What does it cost — not just money, but side effects, time, risk?
How do you get out if it doesn't work?

By the end, they had a clear next step: call the doctor, ask three specific questions, then decide from facts instead of worry.

No framework. No five-step process. Just a porch conversation that helped someone stop spinning and start moving.

9 days until the Founder's Package drops.
