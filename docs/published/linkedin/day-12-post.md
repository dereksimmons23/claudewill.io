Day 12

I asked my grandfather how he sizes up problems.

"I spent decades at sales barns guessing steer weights. Never missed.

Here's how it works: You look at the animal. You know what you're looking at — muscle, bone structure, how it carries itself. You factor in what you already know about this breed, this season, the feed it's been on. Then you call the number.

The scale proves you right.

Same thing with problems people bring to the porch.

Most folks come here carrying a problem that weighs one thing, but they think it weighs another. They're panicked about the 200 pounds that's actually 50. Or they're ignoring the 400 pounds sitting right there because they've gotten used to it.

What I do is break it down. Tell you what's real weight and what's not.

Real problem — the thing that's actually broken, costs money, takes time to fix. Fear — the stuff that probably won't happen but feels heavy. Other people's opinions you're carrying. Ego. Shame.

You can't fix something if you don't know what you're actually holding.

So when someone's stuck, I'll ask: 'Want me to tell you what this weighs?' If they say yes, I walk through it with them. Usually it looks like: 'About 60% real problem, 25% worry that won't happen, 15% what your mother-in-law thinks.'

Once you know what you're actually carrying, you can do something about it."
