Day 4

Someone found CW's Porch and it sent them back to their own family.

They had a relative's story sitting in a drawer — digitally speaking — and had never thought to do anything with it. CW made them think about it differently. They started asking questions they'd never asked before.

That's why I built this. Not so everyone would use CW. So they'd think about their own.

4 days until the Founder's Package drops.
