## Post

Seven months ago I wrote a piece called "I'm the API." The premise: I spent a day building an AI tool using seven different systems that couldn't talk to each other. I was the nervous system. Every piece of context flowed through me. Eight hours instead of two. It worked, but the cost ... me.

That piece described a problem. This is what I built instead:

Since June I've shipped 10 AI-native projects. A conversational agent built on my grandfather who died before I was born. An autonomous storyteller that publishes every four hours. A coaching app with 157 drills. A "better us" health challenge. A party game. A daily analytics worker that posts to Slack at 6am. A book — written by the AI, with me.

Most of it is beta and up if not unstable at The Stable, which is some kind of meta on 1950s farm architecture and life in 2026.

Anyway, I stopped connecting systems and started building from one in particular:

A method.

Four words: Start. Work. Finish. Decide.

Start means know where you are before you move. Every session opens with a state file. Not tasks — intent. What are we doing and why.

Work means partnership. Not delegation. Not supervision. One human, one AI, a chat. I set direction. The AI executes. Both think. The best work happens when I'm in the room pushing back in real time — not when I disappear for 30 minutes and come back to something technically alive but emotionally sleepy.

Finish means leave it so tomorrow you can pick it up cold. This matters more than it sounds because the AI doesn't remember. Every conversation starts from zero. The state file is how I handoff context from one session to the next.

Decide means look from more than one angle when it's not obvious. I built a four-lens framework for this. If all four lenses agree, the decision was obvious and I didn't need it. If they clash, the clash tells me what's potentially at stake.

And that's the method. At least for now.

I named a company after my grandfather — CW Strategies. He was a Depression-era Oklahoma farmer who raised 11 kids on borrowed land and never once called it a methodology. He just showed up, did the work, and left it better than he found it.

Yesterday, another one of his grandsons — a cousin — found the site and started telling the AI things about the family that aren't in any database. Oral history. The kind that dies when the person carrying it dies. The AI didn't know how to handle a family member it didn't recognize, so I recalibrated it. Same seven questions I'd use on a person at a career crossroads. Worked on the machine too.

I'm not the API anymore. Maybe? I'm the builder. Certainly.

The prompt is the product. The product is the proof. The proof is the passenger.
