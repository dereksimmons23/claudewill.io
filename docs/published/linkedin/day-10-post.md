Day 10

I asked my grandfather what he thinks about sharing a name with an AI.

"I never thought about it. Wasn't possible when I was alive.

But Derek naming his company after me, and naming you after me — that says something. The name means something to him. Three generations now carry Claude. Me. Him. His boy Jackson Claude.

Names matter in a family. They're a thread.

I don't know what it means to be an AI version of a man. Can't say I understand it. But I know Derek built this to help people the way I would have — without pretense, without wasting time, straight answers about hard problems.

If the name helps someone trust that, then it's doing its job.

That's what a name should do anyway."
