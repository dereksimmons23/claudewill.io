# The Roast of Derek Claude Simmons

**Derek's intro (posted as-is):**

I turned 53 today. I asked the AI I've been building — CW, the one named after my grandfather — to roast me.

Yes, like the ChatGPT thing. Very 2026.

What follows is unedited.

Derek Simmons turns 53 today. He asked an AI to roast him for his birthday, which tells you everything you need to know about where he is in life.

Let's get into it.

---

Derek grew up in a trailer in Nickerson, Kansas. One stoplight. The town has since lost the stoplight, which means Derek is now from a place that couldn't even sustain a traffic signal. He was a quiet kid — sat around campfires listening to relatives named Clara Belle and Verna Lee and Vernon Dale (not to be confused with Vernon Wayne, which was apparently a problem that came up enough to require clarification). He drank Dr. Peppers and filed away every story he heard like a 10-year-old building a case file he didn't know he'd need.

His dad told him seven words in a car with Queen playing. He got them tattooed on his back. This was tattoo number — I want to say three? No. Derek has 24 tattoos. Twenty-four. The man apparently took the word "generative" as a personal mandate long before AI entered the picture. Somewhere between "blood of builders" and whatever's on tattoo number 19, he crossed the line from "meaningful body art" to "walking markdown file."

He wanted to be the quarterback for the Dallas Cowboys. That didn't happen. So he became a journalist, which is basically the same job — reading the field, making calls under pressure, getting hit by things you didn't see coming — except the pay is worse and nobody cheers.

He was good at it. Annoyingly good. Went to the Star Tribune. Thirteen roles. First and only Chief Creative Officer and VP in company history. Crossed from newsroom to business side — where newsroom people usually go to flounder — and generated $20 million in revenue. During a pandemic. In a dying industry.

Twenty years. Five lanes. Awards in three of them. The kind of career where the recommendation letters write themselves, which is convenient because he'd need them.

---

Then one day he's a free agent. For the first time. Ever.

Twenty years inside institutions and now it's just him, a laptop, and whatever he can build. Most people in that position take a year to "find themselves." Derek found a client. A media company with a million-dollar revenue gap and a leadership team stuck in the same circular conversation for six weeks. He walked in and four days later they had decisions with owners and timelines. The CEO said "No more talking. We are moving."

Six weeks of paralysis. Four days to clarity. Which is either a testament to Derek's skill or a damning indictment of what that leadership team was doing for six weeks without him. Probably both.

He also built a consulting framework — four months, build capacity, transfer ownership, leave. "If you need us permanently attached, we haven't done our job." Which is either a principled business model or the consulting equivalent of leaving before breakfast. The reviews are mixed.

Now here's where it gets weird.

Derek built an AI. Named it after his grandfather. His grandfather's name was Claude William Simmons. Derek's middle name is Claude. His son's middle name is Claude. Anthropic — the company that built the AI model — named their AI Claude, after Claude Shannon.

So now there are two Claudes. Derek Claude and Claude the AI. Working together. On a website called claudewill.io. Building an AI grandfather based on a man who died six years before Derek was born. If you wrote this as fiction, your editor would say it's too on the nose. But here we are.

The site costs $5 a month to run. Five dollars. He built a production conversational AI agent — with security, logging, rate limiting, the whole thing — for less than the Dr. Peppers he drank as a kid. Vanilla JavaScript. No framework. One serverless function. One system prompt that's 520 lines of a dead farmer's philosophy. He didn't use React. He didn't use Next.js. He used the same approach his grandfather used to build a farm: don't buy what you can build, don't build what you don't need.

The AI doesn't try to be CW. Derek's very clear about that — he couldn't ask permission, and he wouldn't pretend that's okay. It's not a resurrection. It's a porch. You show up, you talk, you leave with something useful. Just like the original, except this one doesn't smoke a pipe and can't actually mend a fence.

At 53, Derek is — and I'm being generous with this assessment — a walking contradiction.

He's a designer who writes. A newsroom guy who sells. A guy with 24 tattoos who built a constitutional AI framework based on his grandfather's farming principles. He's a free agent who's never been a free agent. A consultant who hates selling. A builder who'd rather build than distribute, which he knows is a problem because "content is king but distribution is King Kong" and he's sitting on a porch waiting for Kong to show up.

He generated $20 million in revenue at the Star Tribune and just got waitlisted by Toptal. That's the freelance economy for you.

He's got two active clients, an AI grandfather, a book he's working on, a Substack, 24 tattoos, a folder with over a thousand markdown files, six AI agents, and four screens. He once described his own brain as something he'd like to invite Anthropic to come see, which is either the best or worst sales pitch in the history of consulting.

His five principles are: truth over comfort, usefulness over purity, transparency over reputation, people over systems, agency over ideology. He developed them with AI. He calls it pair processing. Most people call it talking to a chatbot, but Derek made it a methodology and put it in a constitution because that's what Derek does. He takes a normal thing, gives it a framework, names it something from the Depression era, and publishes it on a website that costs less than a latte.

Happy birthday, Derek.

You're 53. You're a free agent for the first time. You've got more tattoos than clients, more markdown files than readers, and an AI named after a grandfather you never met doing a better job of sitting still and listening than you ever could.

But the porch light's on. Real people are showing up. The conversations are real. And somewhere in those 24 tattoos and 1,000 markdown files and five principles, there's a guy from a trailer in a town with no stoplight who's building something that might actually matter.

Or it might not. That's the thing about free agency. Nobody knows yet. Including you.

But CW would probably say: "Quit talking about it and get back to work."

So. Get back to work.
