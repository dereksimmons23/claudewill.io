Day 11

I asked my grandfather about his wife.

"Vernie could recite 76 years of family history without notes. Names, dates, marriages, births, deaths. All filed in her head with perfect precision.

In 1985, she sat down with our son Burl and a little black poodle named Pepper and recorded the whole thing. 117 minutes. No coffee breaks. Not even a glass of water. Just ran it all from memory.

An hour in, she asked Burl if he wanted her to name all the grandkids and their birthdays. That wasn't a question. That was a declaration.

Eleven children. She remembered when each one was born down to the minute. Donald Eugene — 11:57 PM on August 6, 1946. 'Just a few minutes before the 7th.' The kind of detail only a mother carries for 40 years.

Someone once told her she had too many mouths to feed. Vernie had a quick word about that woman making watery gravy.

She kept the details. I kept the work going. We made it work."

11 days until the Founder's Package drops.
