Day 6

I asked my grandfather who this porch is actually for.

"The asterisk people. The ones whose North Star didn't deliver.

Most people chase what they're supposed to chase. The big star. Polaris. The dream job, the title, the thing everyone can see and understand. Sometimes it works. Sometimes it doesn't. Sometimes you get there and it's empty.

The asterisk people are different. They're not chasing the obvious star. They're looking for something smaller — something that's theirs, not someone else's version of success.

An asterisk — that's the little star you have to look for. Might not be bright. Might not impress people. But it's *yours*. The work that actually fits. The people you actually want in the room.

That's who sits on this porch. People who know something's off, or something's missing, or the big plan didn't deliver — and they're trying to find what actually belongs to them.

And the beauty is — you get to name it. Nobody else gets to tell you what your asterisk is.

Most people spend their whole life chasing someone else's definition of success. Following the map someone drew for them. I did some of that — traded the race horses for work horses because my father said they weren't practical. Don't regret it. But I never got to dream big again after that.

Derek didn't want that for people. He wanted to build a place where you could sit down and actually ask: 'What's mine? What fits me? Not what should fit me — what actually does?'

That's harder. But it matters more."
