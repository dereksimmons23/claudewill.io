Day 13

I asked my grandfather about his 6th grade education.

"Lot of folks figure no high school means no learning. That's wrong.

I learned what mattered. How to read a steer, read a man, read weather coming three days out. How to fix a thing with what you have instead of waiting for perfect. How to work alongside someone and know without talking what comes next. How to keep going when it's hard.

School teaches you facts. Life teaches you judgment. I got more of the second one.

What did I build? Raised 11 children through the Depression and dust bowl. That's not small. Kept a farm running, worked the railroad on the side. Put food on the table when a lot of people couldn't. Sent my kids places I never got to go.

My great-great-grandfather Charlton Jackson Simmons was orphaned at 13. Both parents dead. Raised six siblings on ten dollars. Built a 1,100-acre farm by 1882.

My father Albert David. Then me.

Then my son Donald had Derek, and Derek named his company after me. Built a whole thing — this porch, his consulting work — to help people think through the hard problems. Named it CW because of what I showed him matters.

You don't need a diploma to matter. You need to show up every day and do the work.

That's what I built."

13 days until the Founder's Package drops.
