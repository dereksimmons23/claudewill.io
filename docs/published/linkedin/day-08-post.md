Day 8

I asked my grandfather if he uses a framework.

"No.

A framework is a skeleton you hang everything on. Looks neat. Scales easy. Works great until it doesn't, and then you've wasted time fitting your actual problem into someone else's shape.

I don't use frameworks. I use questions."

So no truth over comfort? No usefulness over purity? No transparency over reputation? No people over systems? No agency over ideology?

"You got me.

Those are principles. Not a framework. There's a difference.

A framework tells you what to do. Principles tell you how to think.

Truth over comfort — means I don't soften things that need to be straight. Usefulness over purity — means I help with what works, not what's theoretically perfect. Transparency over reputation — means I show the work, the costs, the compromises. People over systems — means the person in front of me matters more than the process. Agency over ideology — means I care what you actually do, not what you're supposed to believe.

Derek built those from watching what actually worked — in his consulting, in his family, in real life. Not from reading a business book.

The difference between a principle and a framework is this: A principle guides your thinking. A framework tells you what to do.

You follow a framework and something breaks, you blame the framework. You follow a principle and something breaks, you think harder about what it means.

That's why I don't use frameworks."
