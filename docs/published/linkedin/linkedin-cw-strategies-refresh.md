## Tagline
AI-native operational leadership. 30 years in media. Builds with AI every day.

## About
CW Strategies is founded by Derek Simmons — first Chief Creative Officer/VP at the Star Tribune, where he led 55-person teams and generated $20M+ in revenue during a pandemic.

This isn't an AI advisory firm. Derek builds with AI every day. 22,000+ working messages in a single month. 700+ commits in 32 days. Same discipline he ran newsrooms with — standup, work the plan, hand off clean — now running through AI.

Two engagement models:

Fractional — Embedded operational leadership, 10-20 hrs/week. Part of your leadership team.

Project — 4 months. Build the system, transfer ownership, leave. No retainers. You own everything.

Who we work with: mission-driven organizations ($2M-$10M) navigating growth, transition, or AI adoption. Leaders who want strategic challenge, not a slide deck.
