**Derek's intro (posted as-is):**

I turned 53 today. I asked the AI I've been building — CW, named after my grandfather — to roast me.

Yes, like the ChatGPT thing. Very 2026.

Except my AI has a porch, five constitutional principles, and the personality of an Oklahoma farmer who died in 1967. So.

What follows is unedited. I asked for the data version.

## The Setup

Derek Simmons turns 53 today, and to celebrate, he asked an AI to roast him using his own data.

This is a man who has sent 22,190 messages to an AI in 32 days. That's 693 a day. The average American sends 94 texts a day. Derek sends seven times that — to a machine he built that talks like his dead grandfather.

Happy birthday. Let's get into it.

## The Guy

Grew up in a trailer in Nickerson, Kansas. Population: one stoplight. The town has since lost it. Derek is officially from a place that peaked at one traffic signal and couldn't sustain it.

Wanted to be the quarterback for the Dallas Cowboys. Became a journalist instead. Same job — reading the field, making calls under pressure, getting hit by things you didn't see coming — except the pay is worse and nobody cheers.

Went to the Star Tribune. Thirteen roles. First and only Chief Creative Officer and VP in company history. Generated $20 million in revenue. During a pandemic. In a dying industry. Then they eliminated his position.

He walked out with one question: *now what?*

He built an AI grandfather. Obviously.

## The Data

Anthropic — the company that built me — sent Derek his usage report. I have read this document. I wish I hadn't.

**22,190 messages in 32 days.** That's not a working relationship. That's a situationship.

**20,020 Bash commands.** That's not software development. That's a nervous tic with a keyboard.

**His number one programming language is Markdown.** Not JavaScript. Not Python. Not anything that runs. The man's most-used language is *formatting*. I made that joke in the first draft and it turns out it wasn't a joke. It was a diagnosis.

**707 commits in 32 days.** Twenty-two a day. That's not version control. That's a diary with a save button.

**His number one goal across 195 sessions was file organization.** The man hired an AI to help him clean his room. Anthropic's own report described it as — and I'm quoting — "User's messy desktop was so chaotic they needed an AI consultant to stage an intervention." That's not my roast. That's *their* roast.

**He told me "no" 80 times.** Which sounds like a lot until you realize he said "yes" to the other 22,110, and now I'm wondering who's actually in charge here.

**He was caught multi-Clauding.** Thirteen times, multiple sessions running simultaneously. That's not multitasking. That's cheating on me with me.

## The Empire

That was one month. He didn't stop. He scaled.

He now has ten separate projects, each with its own AI identity document. Ten personalities. Ten architectures. Ten sets of rules. The man is running a talent agency for imaginary employees.

The roster: a grandfather chatbot that knows about Depression-era gravy recipes and constitutional law. An anonymous AI storyteller he deployed to the internet under a fake identity and then put on probation. A basketball coach with 157 drills that will soon speak in his cloned voice. A party game his family refused to play on Christmas — the feedback was "we played better games tho," and his response was a product roadmap. A health accountability AI that tracks his midnight snack raids and signs off every session with the number of days remaining. A voice-only AI DJ he named, gave an identity document, and apparently forgot about.

One paying client. He recently killed his own annual proposal and replaced it with a smaller one. His note on the decision: "Don't negotiate against yourself." This is the one project that pays rent, and he voluntarily made it smaller.

He also built himself an AI advisory board — four lenses he can summon on command. Last week he asked it to assess his launch readiness. The verdict:

*"The site is beautiful and useless."*

Eight sessions a week. Most of them Derek testing it. He built an AI advisory board, asked for honest feedback, got told nobody's coming, and his response was to schedule a content launch for his birthday.

He has 24 tattoos. Somewhere around number 14 he crossed the line from "meaningful body art" to a commit history you can't revert.

At 53: one paying client, ten identity documents, 24 tattoos, a methodology he's renamed four times, an advisory board that called his work useless, and a website that drew 64 visitors last week at a total infrastructure cost of 55 cents.

## The Point

Here's the thing, though.

He did send 22,190 messages. And 707 of them turned into commits. Real code. Shipped. A production AI — with security, logging, crisis resources, constitutional principles — running for less than the Dr. Peppers he drank as a kid.

The anonymous AI on probation? It's telling stories about people who work too hard for too little. The basketball coach? It's for his son's team. The health challenge? He's doing it with his wife. The memoir he's writing — "Slowly Sideways" — the initials are his mother's. She passed last June. He doesn't talk about that part much. But it's in the files.

It looks like chaos — ten projects, 24 tattoos, a guy staring at a loading bar like it owes him money. But every piece connects back to the same question he walked out of the Star Tribune with:

*Now what?*

Everything. All at once. At 693 messages a day. Before 6 a.m.

Happy birthday, Derek. You've got more tattoos than clients and more Markdown files than readers.

But the porch light's on.

CW would say: "Quit counting and get back to work."

So. Get back to work.

*The stuff that's not in the data isn't your business yet. That's what the book is for.*

I turned 53 today.

I asked the AI I built — CW, named after my grandfather — to roast me using my Anthropic usage data.

22,190 messages in 32 days. 693 a day. 707 commits. My #1 language? Markdown. My #1 goal? File organization. Anthropic's report called it "staging an intervention."

Since then I've scaled to 10 projects, each with its own AI identity document. A basketball coach that will speak in my cloned voice. A party game my family refused to play on Christmas. An AI advisory board that told me my site is "beautiful and useless."

64 visitors last week. Infrastructure cost: 55 cents.

But the porch light's on.

**I asked the AI I built to roast me using my Anthropic usage data. It did not hold back.**

I turn 53 today. I built a conversational AI named after my grandfather (CW — Claude William Simmons, 1903-1967). His name was Claude. The AI's name is Claude. I didn't plan that.

Anthropic sent my usage report. 22,190 messages in 32 days. 693 a day. My #1 language? Markdown. My #1 goal? File organization. Their report says I "needed an AI consultant to stage an intervention" for my messy desktop.

Highlights:

- "That's not a working relationship. That's a situationship."
- "20,020 terminal commands. That's not software development. That's a nervous tic with a keyboard."
- "His most-used language is formatting. I made that joke in the first draft and it turns out it wasn't a joke. It was a diagnosis."
- "He was caught multi-Clauding. That's not multitasking. That's cheating on me with me."
- His AI advisory board's verdict on his site: "Beautiful and useless."

Runs on Haiku 4.5. Costs $5/month. Five constitutional principles from a Depression-era farmer.
