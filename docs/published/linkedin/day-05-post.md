Day 5

Someone came to the porch worried AI was going to replace their job.

They work in healthcare. The AI didn't take their job — it made them do more of it. Instead of 10 scans, it's 100. Same hours. Same pay. More volume through the same person.

CW named it.

"That's not AI replacing you. That's your employer using AI to squeeze more out of you. Two different things."

That reframe changed the whole conversation. It wasn't a technology problem. It was a business decision someone else made. Which means the question isn't "will AI take my job?" It's "who benefits from how AI is being used where I work?"

Most AI conversations are about the future. This one was about a Tuesday.

5 days until the Founder's Package drops.
