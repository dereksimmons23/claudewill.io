Here is a detailed technical specification for the Claude Will Widget, ready to be added to your unified `roadmap_and_project_plan.md`:

---

## Technical Specification

### 1. Architecture Overview

- **Type:** Vanilla JavaScript widget, no framework dependencies.
- **Integration:** Injected via a `<script>` tag and initialized on DOMContentLoaded.
- **UI:** Renders a floating chat widget on every page, styled via a dedicated CSS file.
- **Context Awareness:** Detects the current page context (e.g., resume, documentation, about) for context-sensitive responses.
- **Accessibility:** Uses ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, and responsive design for accessibility and mobile support.

---

### 2. Component Structure

- **Widget Container (`.claude-will-widget`):**The root element, fixed to the bottom-right of the viewport.
- **Toggle Button (`.widget-toggle`):**Opens/closes the chat interface; accessible via keyboard and screen readers.
- **Widget Content (`.widget-content`):**Contains the chat interface, header, body, and close button.
- **Header (`.widget-header`):**Displays the widget title and a close button.
- **Body (`.widget-body`):**Contains the chat messages and input form.
- **Chat Messages (`.chat-messages`):**Scrollable area for conversation history.
- **Chat Input (`.chat-input`):**
  Text input and send button for user messages.

---

### 3. Data Flow & Logic

- **Initialization:**
  - Widget is appended to `document.body` on page load.
  - Event listeners are set up for toggling, closing, submitting input, and mobile-specific behaviors.
- **Context Detection:**
  - Uses `window.location.pathname` to set `currentContext` (e.g., 'resume-engine', 'documentation', 'about').
- **User Interaction:**
  - User types a message and submits via the form.
  - Message is added to the chat history.
  - Widget calls `window.ClaudeWill.getResponse(formattedMessage)` to get a response (integration point for backend/AI).
  - Response is displayed in the chat.
- **Mobile & Accessibility:**
  - Handles virtual keyboard, pull-to-refresh, and orientation changes.
  - Responsive design adapts layout for small screens.
  - ARIA labels and keyboard navigation for accessibility.

---

### 4. Styling & Theming

- **CSS File:** `/css/claude-will-widget.css`
- **Key Features:**
  - Fixed position, rounded corners, drop shadows for modern look.
  - Responsive breakpoints for mobile and small screens.
  - Theming via CSS variables (e.g., `--color-primary`).
  - Dark mode support via `@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark)`.
  - High-contrast and accessible color choices.
  - Large touch targets for mobile usability.

---

### 5. Extensibility & Integration Points

- **Backend Integration:**
  - Expects a global `window.ClaudeWill.getResponse()` function for AI/chat responses.
- **Enhancements:**
  - Can be extended with conversation memory, advanced context detection, or richer UI.
  - Additional logic (e.g., from `claude-will-chat-enhancement.js`) can be integrated for advanced features like topic tracking, follow-ups, and cross-domain pattern recognition.

---

### 6. Accessibility & UX

- **Keyboard Navigation:**
  - All interactive elements are focusable and operable via keyboard.
- **Screen Reader Support:**
  - ARIA labels on toggle and close buttons.
- **Mobile Support:**
  - Touch-friendly controls, pull-to-refresh, and orientation handling.
- **Performance:**
  - Lightweight, loads asynchronously, minimal impact on page load.

---

### 7. Security Considerations

- **Input Validation:**
  - User input is trimmed and sanitized before processing.
- **Isolation:**
  - Widget runs in its own DOM subtree, minimizing risk of interfering with page content.
- **Error Handling:**
  - Graceful fallback if the backend/AI is unavailable.

---

### 8. Deployment & Usage

- **Include in HTML:**
  ```html
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="/css/claude-will-widget.css">
  <script src="/js/claude-will-widget.js"></script>
  <script>
    document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function() {
      new ClaudeWillWidget();
    });
  </script>
  ```
- **Customization:**
  - The widget can be themed or extended by modifying the CSS or JS files.
