## The Claude Connection: A Legacy of Wisdom

The name "Claude" carries deep personal significance for Derek—it's his middle name, passed down through generations of his family. His grandfather, **Claude William Simmons (known as CW)**, embodied the practical wisdom and pattern recognition that now inform The CW Standard methodology.

When Derek discovered Anthropic's Claude AI and found extraordinary collaboration potential, the connection felt like more than coincidence. It became the foundation for a new approach to human-AI partnership—one that honors both technological capability and human wisdom.
