- ✅ **Security**: All dependencies secure, no vulnerabilities
- ✅ **Linting**: Code quality tools working properly
- ✅ **Basketball App**: One thing that actually works well at `/basketball`

### **The Bad News**

- ❌ **User Experience**: Site is confusing and hard to navigate
- ❌ **Design**: Inconsistent, unprofessional appearance
- ❌ **Functionality**: Core features don't work as expected
- ❌ **Information Architecture**: "Nearly impossible to find answers"
- ❌ **Repository**: "Unwieldy as all get-out" - too complex

## 📊 **TECHNICAL INVENTORY**

### **What's Actually Working**

```
✅ index.html - Loads but confusing
✅ /basketball - Fully functional app
✅ /pages/about.html - Basic functionality
✅ /pages/contact.html - Basic functionality
✅ CSS/JS - No critical errors
✅ GitHub Actions - CI/CD pipeline working
```

### **What's Broken or Problematic**

```

❌ /pages/resume.html - Overlaps with other systems
❌ Navigation - Inconsistent across pages
❌ Assessment flow - Unclear user journey
❌ Design system - Multiple conflicting styles
❌ Content organization - Scattered and redundant
```

### **What's Cluttering the Repo**

```
📁 archived/ - 110MB+ of legacy systems
📁 career-intelligence/ - Complex React app of unclear value
📁 js/research/ - Experimental code
📁 docs/ - Outdated documentation
📁 Multiple resume systems - Overlapping functionality
```

## 🎯 **CORE PROBLEMS**

### **1. Identity Crisis**

- **Problem**: Unclear what Claude Will actually does
- **Evidence**: Multiple overlapping systems, confusing navigation
- **Impact**: Users leave without understanding the value

### **2. Feature Bloat**

- **Problem**: Too many half-built features
- **Evidence**: 5+ resume systems, experimental code, unused components
- **Impact**: Maintenance nightmare, user confusion

### **3. Design Inconsistency**

- **Problem**: Multiple CSS systems fighting each other
- **Evidence**: global.css, modern.css, style.css, component styles
- **Impact**: Unprofessional appearance, poor user experience

### **4. Information Overload**

- **Problem**: Too much content, poor organization
- **Evidence**: User says "nearly impossible to find answers"
- **Impact**: Users can't accomplish their goals

## 💡 **WHAT USERS ACTUALLY NEED**

### **Current Reality**

1. **Arrive** → Confusion about identity
2. **Explore** → Lost in navigation maze
