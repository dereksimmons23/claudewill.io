# Derek Simmons: Award-Winning Visual Design Leader

Derek Simmons stands as one of America's most accomplished visual journalism leaders, with **25+ years of newsroom experience** and a track record that includes record-breaking design awards and transformational creative leadership at two premier news organizations. His work has consistently placed publications among the world's top design competitors, earning recognition alongside The New York Times and The Washington Post.

## Record-breaking achievement at Society for News Design

Simmons achieved what industry insiders called **"a real mind blower"** when he led the Star Tribune to three consecutive Top 10 finishes worldwide at the Society for News Design's Creative Competition from 2015-2017. The 2015 achievement marked the first time in company history that Star Tribune reached this elite level, competing among 9,500+ global entries. Most remarkably, the Star Tribune earned a **record 43 awards** in 2015 alone, demonstrating sustained excellence that continued through 2016 and 2017.

This achievement was particularly significant because it elevated the Star Tribune alongside "most respected peers" including the Los Angeles Times, The New York Times, and The Washington Post — publications traditionally dominating international design competitions. The consistency of this three-year performance established Simmons as a transformational leader capable of elevating organizational design capabilities to world-class standards.

## Transformational leadership at Los Angeles Times

As Deputy Design Director at the Los Angeles Times from 2007-2013, Simmons helped orchestrate one of the most successful periods in design competition history. Under his leadership, **the LA Times won 125+ awards** at Society for News Design competitions and was the top winner in SND's international competition for six consecutive years. During his tenure, the publication claimed the top spot in 9 out of 10 years, with a peak performance of 109 awards in 2008—the most in competition history at that time.

This sustained excellence across multiple years demonstrates Simmons' ability to build and maintain design systems that consistently produce award-winning work. His leadership during this period established the LA Times as the gold standard for news design excellence, a reputation that influenced industry practices across visual journalism.

## Chief Creative Officer expertise and innovation

Since being promoted to Chief Creative Officer at Star Tribune Media Co. in 2016, Simmons has expanded his role beyond traditional design leadership. He's recognized as **"a pioneer with AI"** who spearheaded efforts to integrate artificial intelligence across the business, speaking at major technology conferences including AWS Gen AI Loft alongside Stanford professors. His current role encompasses developing innovative print and digital solutions while maintaining the publication's visual philosophy company-wide.

Simmons has led the cultural transformation from a "words first" approach to integrated visual storytelling, emphasizing what he calls the "perfect marriage of visuals and words." His technical expertise spans InDesign, Photoshop, and Illustrator, with specializations in page design, typography, information layering, and visual storytelling that bridge traditional print excellence with digital innovation.

## Professional reputation and industry standing

Industry colleagues describe Simmons as **"a forceful agent for change"** who belongs to "a new generation of visual journalists who understood intrinsically the power of images, graphics and design." His professional reputation combines technical excellence with collaborative leadership—described as "congenial, smart, diplomatic but also inspiring" with particular skill at "getting people behind good ideas."

His career trajectory from visual journalist to design director to chief creative officer reflects sustained growth in both creative and management capabilities. Colleagues note his development "into a skillful and insightful manager" while maintaining his creative edge and commitment to innovation. This combination of creative vision and leadership effectiveness has made him a sought-after voice in discussions about the future of journalism and design.

## Conclusion

Derek Simmons has established himself as one of the most accomplished leaders in contemporary visual journalism, with concrete achievements that include record-breaking award wins, sustained excellence across multiple premier organizations, and recognition as an industry pioneer in both traditional design and emerging technologies. His work consistently elevates publications to compete at the highest international levels while fostering innovation that shapes the future of visual storytelling. The combination of his **43-award record**, three consecutive global Top 10 finishes, and leadership during the LA Times' dominant period creates a portfolio of achievement that few in the industry can match.


**Note from Michael and Colin about my departure from The Los Angeles Times:**

It is with a mix of feelings we announce deputy design director Derek Simmons is departing The Times to return to the Minneapolis Star Tribune as assistant managing editor for visuals.

Derek arrived at the Times six years ago and made an immediate impact. His creativity and attention to detail helped push the design of Business and Sports, especially Sports special sections, to new heights.

He was part of the team that redesigned the paper in 2008, against the grain of over design sweeping the industry. He made contributions to our best news projects, our Oscars coverage, our overall use of illustration, and helped create the Saturday section.

During his time with us, The Times won more design awards from the Society for News Design than any paper over any similar period ever.

To put it simply, he made us better. We are sad he is leaving but proud he is moving on to such a great opportunity. He earned it.

Derek's last day is Dec. 4. Please stop by and wish him well.
