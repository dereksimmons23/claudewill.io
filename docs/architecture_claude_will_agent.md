# Claude Will Agent: Technical Architecture & Stack

## Overview
Claude Will is a human-centered AI agent and knowledge platform, blending the legacy of the CW Standard with state-of-the-art machine learning and constitutional AI principles.

## Core Components
- **Frontend:** React (Electron.js for desktop app)
- **Backend:** Python (FastAPI or Flask)
- **Database:** SQLite (local), ChromaDB (vector search/embeddings)
- **AI Engine:**
  - **Primary:** Anthropic Claude API (for natural language understanding, reasoning, and conversation)
  - **Optional:** OpenAI GPT-4, local LLMs (for fallback or multi-model querying)
- **Knowledge Processing:**
  - Markdown file ingestion and parsing
  - Embedding generation (ChromaDB, OpenAI, or HuggingFace)
  - Semantic and keyword search
  - Knowledge graph visualization (e.g., D3.js, Cytoscape)
- **Constitutional AI Layer:**
  - System prompts and guardrails inspired by Anthropic’s constitutional AI research
  - Customizable value-alignment rules (RWTFYA, CW Standard)

## Key Features
- Local file indexing and semantic search
- Multi-model AI querying (Claude, GPT-4, etc.)
- Knowledge graph visualization
- User feedback and continuous learning loop
- Transparent, values-aligned decision-making

## Example Workflow
1. User adds markdown files to the platform.
2. Files are indexed, parsed, and embedded for semantic search.
3. User queries the agent (Claude Will) via chat or search interface.
4. Claude Will responds, referencing indexed knowledge and applying constitutional AI guardrails.
5. User feedback is collected to improve future responses and system alignment.
