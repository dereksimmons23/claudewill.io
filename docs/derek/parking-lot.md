## The Nicknames Opening (First Person)

*For social, Substack, or Slowly Sideways — not the /derek bio page.*

Hello. I'm Derek.

You don't give yourself a nickname. Other people do. And if you're lucky, the names tell a story.

As a kid growing up in a one-stoplight town, I was Deek. My mom called me Deekers. As I grew up, the variations changed with the assignments.

Papa. Coach. QB1. Nick Nickerson. Mr. Beards. D-Rock. D. Plate-breaker. Builder. Developer. Million-dollar idea guy. Grizzly Bear. Fence-sitter. Chief Creative Officer. Designer. Vice President. Squirt. D-Claude. Simmons. Simmonivich.

Terms of endearment and some that weren't.

If I had to pick one, it would still be Derek — the name my mother gave me in 1973. The other names tell stories, but when I look in the mirror, I still hear her voice. The one who raised me. The best coach I ever had.

## Notes

- Nickerson, Kansas is the one-stoplight town
- This overlaps with Slowly Sideways territory (names, voices, grandiosity)
- Keep for later — Substack essay, book excerpt, or social thread
- Don't add to founder's package scope
