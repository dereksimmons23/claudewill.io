## Who Is Derek?

Derek Simmons is a builder. He starts things, fixes broken things, and makes teams better.

**The receipts:**

Two newspapers. Both became the best in the world while he was there.

- **Los Angeles Times** — #1 worldwide design ranking (Society for News Design) for six consecutive years. Pulitzer Prize team recognition.
- **Star Tribune** — #3 worldwide, $20M+ in subscription, sponsorship, and advertising revenue generated. Another Pulitzer. 55-person team. First and only Chief Creative Officer in the company's history.

He helped build startribune.com. He's worked across sports, business, features, politics, investigations, and tech. He's led teams, built products, launched franchises, and generated seven-figure sponsorships.

Now he runs CW Strategies — AI strategy and media transformation consulting for organizations navigating complexity and change.

## What He Actually Does

**Fixes operational problems.** Organizations hire him when something's broken and they can't figure out what. He finds it, names it, and builds a system to fix it.

**Builds things that work.** Products, teams, workflows, revenue streams. Working systems.

**Makes hard calls.** He'll tell you what's wrong. He'll tell you what it'll take to fix it.

**Connects dots others miss.** Journalism, technology, sports, business, operations, design — he's worked across all of them. The value is in seeing patterns specialists can't.
