## The Insight

I've been called a unicorn. I don't want to be one.

Unicorns get captured by their own longing. They're rare, beautiful, and stuck.

I'd rather be a shapeshifter — harder to catch, more useful, able to become what the team needs.

## The Tension

The shapeshifter can become anyone except himself. That's not a bug. But it's not nothing either.

**The danger:** You play a role so well you forget it's a role. And three years in, you've lost the thread of whatever you were building before you put on the costume.

**The work:** The recalibration. The frameworks. The "who is Derek Simmons" question. That's me trying to write a script for the one role I've never played.

## The Validation

A client told me recently: "Thank God you're a team player, Derek. It's so rare. I'm not used to a team. It freaks me out."

That's the shapeshifter at work. Not claiming to be the smartest person in the room. Becoming what the team needs. Earning trust by showing up differently than expected.

The proof isn't in what I say. It's in what others say when I leave the room.

The catch? The shapeshifter can become anyone except himself.

That's the work I'm doing now. Three decades of playing roles. Now trying to write a script for the one role I've never played.

My own.

### X/Twitter
I've been called a unicorn. I don't want to be one.

Unicorns get captured. Shapeshifters adapt.

The catch: the shapeshifter can become anyone except himself.

That's the work.

## Notes

- This is the identity piece — the throughline for the whole founder story
- Connects to Team Player Validation (Section 13 in case study)
- The "playing yourself" question is unresolved — that's okay, it's honest
- Could be the anchor for the Feb 7 launch: "Who is Derek Simmons?"
