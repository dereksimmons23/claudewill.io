## Memoir Project: Title Strategy & Rationale

### Title Discussion
After review and reflection, the working title for the memoir project is now **Finding Claude**. While "Blood of Thoroughbreds" is a powerful metaphor within the narrative, it carries potential for misinterpretation or controversy if used as the main title. "Finding Claude" is open, personal, and invites curiosity, aligning with the memoir's themes of self-discovery, legacy, and connection.

#### Why Not "Blood of Thoroughbreds"?
- The phrase could be misconstrued as elitist or exclusionary, especially out of context.
- It risks unintended cultural or historical connotations.
- Best practices for memoir titling recommend clarity, approachability, and resonance with a broad audience ([source](https://www.yourstoryfinder.com/blog/how-to-choose-a-title-for-your-memoir)).

#### Why "Finding Claude"?
- Evocative and approachable, with multiple layers of meaning (personal, familial, metaphorical).
- Avoids controversy and is marketable to a wide audience.
- Leaves room for a subtitle or motif referencing the "thoroughbred" metaphor within the book.

### Best Practices for Memoir Titles
- Make the reader curious, not confused.
- Field test titles with trusted readers ([source](https://www.yourstoryfinder.com/blog/how-to-choose-a-title-for-your-memoir)).
- Consider a main title and a clarifying subtitle.
- Use metaphors or repeated phrases from the book as motifs or subtitles, not necessarily as the main title ([source](https://thememoirnetwork.com/best-title-for-a-memoir/)).

**Writing: Finding Claude (Memoir in Progress)**

> "My grandfather Claude once bought two race horses, only to trade them for work horses when the family needed to farm, not race. That choice—between dreams and duty—has shaped my family's legacy. 'Finding Claude' is a journey through generations, exploring what it means to adapt, to belong, and to discover who you are, even as the world changes around you."

## Quantum Kitchen: TED Talk Excerpt

**The Quantum Kitchen: Reimagining Knowledge Work**

> "What if our creative work could exist in multiple states at once—like quantum particles—rather than being forced into rigid, linear workflows? The Quantum Kitchen reimagines knowledge work with intelligence-augmented tools that protect flow, reveal hidden connections, and let ideas evolve across quantum states. It's not just a new productivity tool—it's a paradigm shift for creativity in the digital age."

*This fictional TED Talk explores a visionary framework for the future of knowledge work, blending neuroscience, AI, and design to unlock deeper creativity and connection.*
