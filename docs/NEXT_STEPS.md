# Next Steps - 2025-06-27

## üéØ **IMMEDIATE PRIORITIES**

### **1. Resume System Architecture Consolidation**
**Current Status:** Multiple overlapping resume systems need consolidation

**Systems to Evaluate:**
- **`/resume-engine`** - React-based resume generation system
- **`/ats-decoder`** - ATS optimization tools  
- **`pages/resume.html`** - Static resume display page
- **`/resumes`** - Collection of resume files and templates

**Key Decisions Needed:**
- Should `/resume-engine` and `/ats-decoder` be merged into unified system?
- Keep `pages/resume.html` as static display vs migrate to dynamic generation?
- Consolidate or eliminate `/resumes` folder contents?
- Define clear separation of concerns: display vs generation vs optimization

**Impact:** Critical for site maintainability and user experience clarity

### **2. Production Deployment Decision**
**Current Status:** Dev branch has fully functional consciousness game + stable main branch with dark mode default

**Options:**
- **Option A:** Deploy consciousness game improvements to production (`make prod-deploy`)
  - ‚úÖ Game is fully functional and engaging
  - ‚úÖ Educational value added (service info panels)
  - ‚úÖ Performance optimized (60 FPS, smooth gameplay)
  - ‚ö†Ô∏è Consider: Is the game experience aligned with professional consulting brand?

- **Option B:** Keep main branch stable, continue dev improvements
  - ‚úÖ Production remains professional and stable
  - ‚úÖ More time to refine game experience
  - ‚ö†Ô∏è Visitors miss out on innovative interactive experience

**Recommendation:** Deploy to production - the game showcases AI orchestration philosophy perfectly
