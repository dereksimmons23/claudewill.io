## RWTFYA: The Origin Story


# Podcast transcript

Alright, let's dive in. This time we're getting up close and personal exploring an audio recording where someone opens up about their life, their battles, and what they're hoping for. It's a privilege to have this kind of access to their thoughts. Totally. A raw, unfiltered look into their world. Exactly. And as we go through it, we're going to uncover themes of self-discovery, bouncing back from tough times, family legacy, and the big question, how do you find meaning when the world feels like? Well, a lot. This person's story is full of powerful moments. There's a wrist band with a bold message, a mental health crisis, a sudden job loss, even the dream of writing a book. And that wrist band's a great place to start. Picture this. A black rubber band, plain and simple. One side says Simmons, the other. R-W-T-F-Y-A. Any ideas? I think I've cracked the code. Remember who the F-U-R, right? That's a statement. You got it. And it's much more than a catchy phrase. It's a guiding principle, a reminder to stay through to yourself, especially when things get rough. It all began as a gift from the speaker to his son, Jackson, who was heading off to college in North Dakota. Like a touchstone for him, while navigating a new place. A way to carry a piece at home and family. Precisely. And it says a lot about the values the speaker wants to instill in his son. Now, Jackson's journey wasn't a walk in the park. He dealt with a foot injury and a not-so-supportive environment during his high school basketball years. But guess what? He earned a scholarship to the University of Jamestown. Wow, that's perseverance. So the wrist band represents overcoming those obstacles. A reminder of his strength and his family's unwavering belief in him. It is, but there's a twist. This message of strength and self-assurance takes on a whole new meaning when we get to the speaker's own story. He finds himself overwhelmed by panic attacks, feeling lost, unable to cope. It's a spark contrast to what that wristband stands for. Almost like the wristband becomes a challenge for him. A mirror reflecting his struggle to hold onto his identity while going through a mental health crisis. Now you're getting it. He reaches a point where he needs to remember who he is. More than ever because he feels like he's losing himself. This leads him to make a tough decision, admitting himself to a psychiatric ward. That takes guts, admitting you need help. It shows he's willing to confront his struggles head on. Absolutely. And it's in this vulnerable state that the message, remember who the FUR, takes on a new urgency. It's not just about self-assurance anymore, it's about rediscovering himself. Piecing together his identity, which has been shattered by this crisis. So he's using the wristband initially meant for his son to navigate his own path to healing and self-discovery. It's interesting how the same object can hold such different meanings at different times in our lives. You're right. It shows how our identity is always evolving. It's shaped by our experiences and we need those anchors, those reminders to guide us back to our core when life throws us curveballs. You know, it makes me wonder if for him, remembering who he is became less about holding onto a fixed idea of himself and more about embracing the changes in growth that come with facing tough times. Perfound observation. Remembering who you are isn't about clinging to the past. It's about using those experiences to become who you are meant to be. Now let's switch gears and talk about his career. He mentions working with AI, leading a task force, even hinting at a possible career change. Sounds promising at first. It does, right? But then things take a dramatic turn. Out of the blue, he's fired the day before Halloween no less. Ouch. That's got to sting. It's like a punch in the gut. You can hear the anger and confusion in his voice as he talks about it. Absolutely. It must have felt like a betrayal, especially after pouring so much of himself into his work. He lists off all these projects, add policy, sponsored content, sports betting, showing how much he contributed to the company. And it's not just the work itself, right? It's his commitment to doing things the right way with integrity. It's as if the company's actions go against his personal values, leaving him dissolutioned. That clash makes the remember who the FUR wristband even more relevant. It's about holding onto your principles even when things are falling apart and you're facing ethical dilemmas. Something we all struggle with in our careers for sure. Now in the midst of this career upheaval, he turns to his family for support. He mentions his 80-year-old mother and 55-year-old sister in Lawrence, his wife Sherry and his two sons, Jackson now 20, and Tegan who's about to turn 14. Like he's drawing strength from those connections, seeking comfort and grounding from the people who know him best. And in this context, he reveals his desire to write a book. A book? That's a intriguing. What kind? A book that his father and uncle encouraged him to write, a way to preserve family stories and explore those big themes we've been talking about. Self-discovery, navigating a complex world, staying true to oneself. So he's processing his experiences, trying to make sense of it all by weaving his personal story with broader reflections on life. Exactly. He even mentions three books that are inspiring him. Progressive basketball, Blue Highways and Midnight Library. Each seems to reflect different parts of his journey. I see it. Progressive basketball focuses on fundamentals. Blue Highways is about exploration and connection. And Midnight Library delves into those weighty life choices. Quite a mix, but each one deeply personal. Right. And then he shares this great anecdote about his grandfather, Claude William Simmons, known as CW. He could guess a bull's weight just by looking at it. No way. That's incredible. It is. And get this, CW only had an eighth grade education. He relied on intuition, experience, a deep understanding that went beyond formal schooling. And the name Claude itself holds a special meaning, right? Absolutely. It's a family name, passed down for generations, a symbol of heritage and values. Even his youngest son, Tegan, seems to draft the weight of this legacy. He asks, did you know how many good decisions our ancestors had to make for us just to be here? Wow, deep stuff for someone so young. It shows how connected the past and present are. The impact of choices made by those who came before us. And it circles back to that core idea of remembering who you are, understanding where you come from and recognizing the values that have shaped you. It's like he's coming to terms with the fact that his story isn't just his own. It's intertwined with the experiences of generations passed. Exactly. It adds another layer to the RWT-IYR message. It's not just individual identity. It's about recognizing the tapestry of family, history, and the choices that led to this very moment. He's been through quite a journey, wouldn't you say? The highs and lows of his son's basketball career, battling a mental health crisis, the sudden blow of losing his job, and the grounding influence of family. What do you think driving him now? It feels like he's searching for a purpose. A way to make his work align with his values. He craves genuine connection, finds inspiration in unexpected places, and grapples with the complexities of self-discovery. Be sure to join us in part two as we dig deeper into his vision for the future, and explore what remember who the FUR truly means for him. You know, it's amazing how he goes from feeling totally lost during that mental health crisis to this determination to take back his life, pursue his passions, talk about resilience. Yeah, for sure. There's this real sense of hope that comes to it. He even throws out some wild dreams, like rockstar, college basketball coach, NFL general manager. I mean, they might sound a little out there, but you can tell he's yearning for something more, something that speaks to who he really is. I get that. It's like those aspirations, even though they seem all over the place, point to a deeper need, connection, leadership, creative expression. He's not afraid to aim high. But what really grabbed my attention was his idea for the CW standard, named after his grandfather, of course. Now that sounds interesting. Tell me more about this CW standard. He doesn't go into specifics, but it seems like he wants to create a set of principles. A way to approach work and life rooted in genuineness and integrity. Qualities he clearly admired in his grandfather. So it's like taking that remember who the FUR idea and turn it into something tangible. A set of values he can use to guide his choices and actions. Exactly. He talks about focusing on not just the what, but the who, not just the how, but the why. You can tell he's looking for a deeper meaning, a way to make his work reflect his values, make a real difference. Sounds like he's moving away from just thinking about work as a transaction and towards something with more purpose. He also mentions wanting to spend time on those blue highways, those less traveled paths. Having conversations with people from all walks of life. Yeah, there's a real hunger for authentic human connection. A desire to break free from the digital world and connect with people on a deeper level. It's like he's searching for wisdom, for understanding from people with different views and backgrounds. It's interesting right after all that introspection, after being forced to face his vulnerabilities, he's turning outward. Seeking connection and shared experiences as a way to rebuild, redefine himself. And that's where his interest in Midnight Library comes in. The book explores different realities. The path as our lives could take depending on our choices. So it's about recognizing that our decisions have power that we're constantly shaping our future, even when it doesn't feel like it. Precisely. And I think he's using this as a way to reflect on his own life. Thinking about the paths he didn't take, the decisions that led him to where he is now, maybe even wondering if there are different versions of himself he could explore. It's a way of embracing life's complexity, accepting that there's no single right way to do things. Recognizing all the possibilities that exist within us. It's a powerful approach to self-discovery. And in the middle of all this reflection, he also mentions wanting to teach his grandchildren, pass on the wisdom he's gained, guide them on their own journeys. There's something beautiful about that. Coming full circle, he started by making that wristband for his son. Now he's picturing himself sharing life lessons with the next generation, creating a legacy of self-awareness and resilience. Yeah, and it's not just about passing on knowledge. It's about instilling those core values of curiosity, being non-judgmental, having empathy. He wants to empower them to navigate their own paths with authenticity and integrity. That speaks volumes about his desire to make a positive impact on the world, to create a ripple effect that goes beyond his own life. So let's talk about where he is in this recording. He describes driving along I-35, purposely disconnecting from the digital world, choosing to just be present with his thoughts and feelings. It's such a striking image. He's created this space for reflection, a kind of digital detox, to reconnect with himself, find some clarity amidst all the noise and distractions of modern life. And in that space, he seems to be rediscovering the importance of simplicity. Focusing on what truly brings him joy and fulfillment, he talks about wanting to spend more time with his loved ones, pursue his passions, and contribute to something bigger than himself. There's this sense of peace and purpose that emerges, like he's shedding those layers of expectation and external validation, embracing a more authentic version of himself. It's truly inspiring to witness that kind of transformation. But it makes you wonder, can he hold onto this newfound clarity, this sense of purpose, once he's back in the real world? Can he maintain that balance and gets all the demands and pressures of everyday life? You've hit on a big question, and one I bet a lot of our listeners are asking themselves, it highlights the challenge of integrating our values and dreams into the often chaotic and unpredictable reality of our lives. It's a constant balancing act for many of us, striving for that equilibrium between our inner world and the external world. But what's encouraging is that he's making a conscious choice to prioritize his well-being, his relationships, his passions. Absolutely. He's reminding us that we have the power to shape our own lives, to choose how we react to challenges, and to find what success and happiness truly mean to us. Exactly. He's not waiting for someone to give him permission or seeking validation from others. He's taking ownership of his journey and creating a life that aligns with his values. Now, as we move into part three, I'm curious to see how he plans to put these insights and aspirations into action. How does he envision living out this CW standard in his daily life? It's remarkable how story unfolds, isn't it? From the depths of that mental health crisis to this almost, I don't know, a zem-like state of reflection and intention. Right. Like you went through the fire and came out the other side transformed. Really speaks to the power of self-discovery. Absolutely. And the resilience of the human spirit, you know, his journey shows us how life works, these cycles of ups and downs, clarity and confusion, and how important it is to just allow yourself to process all of it, to learn and grow. He makes a conscious decision to step away from all that noise, tune out the digital distractions, and zero in on what truly matters. His well-being, relationships, values. Like he's seeking a genuine connection, not just with others, but with himself. Exactly. And it resonates so much, especially in today's world. He's reminding us that amidst the constant influx of information and demands, we need to prioritize those essential connections, create space for reflection and self-discovery. Couldn't agree more. And it's not always about these grand gestures or life-altering decisions. He even talks about wanting to be a better dog trainer, you know. Deepen that bond with his furry friend. Oh yeah, that really stuck with me too. Right. It's a beautiful reminder that those profound connections can be found in the simplest things. In everyday moments, shared experiences. Exactly. And for him, it's about wanting a more grounded, intentional life. He's not chasing external validation or material success. He's seeking fulfillment in those everyday interactions, the relationships that truly nourish his soul. Makes you think, huh? And those relationships seem to bring him clarity and purpose. He talks about being a better husband, a more present father, a source of wisdom and guidance for his sons. And it's like he's realizing his legacy isn't about the work he does or the things he achieves. It's about the impact he has on the people he loves. The values he embodies. The way he shows up in the world. Exactly. And he doesn't take that responsibility lightly. He wants to pass those values of curiosity, being non-judgmental, having empathy onto the next generation, help them navigate the complexities of life with authenticity and integrity. A beautiful goal, right? Definitely. He's not just talking about leaving a mark on the world. He's actively shaping his own legacy. Through his relationships, his actions, his commitment to living a life that reflects his values. And it's like he's showing us that remember who the FUR isn't just a personal mantra. It's a way of life, a commitment to showing up as your most authentic self and inspiring others to do the same. And let's be real, it's not always easy. There will be challenges, setbacks, moments of doubt. Of course. But his story reminds us that we have the power to choose how we respond to those challenges, how we define success, how we shape our own narratives. He chose to confront his mental health struggles head on. He walked away from a career that no longer aligned with his values. He decided to prioritize what truly mattered to him. That's a powerful example of living with intention and purpose. It is. So as we wrap up this deep dive, I think it's worth asking ourselves, what does remember who the FUR mean to us? What experiences or relationships have shaped us? How do we hold on to those essential parts of ourselves when life throws us those curveballs? Think about the people who've had an impact on your life. The values that guide you. The moments that tested you made you stronger. Remember those anchors and let them be your compass. This deep dive has been a powerful reminder that our stories matter. Absolutely. That our experiences shape who we are and that we have the power to create a life that reflects our values and aspirations. Couldn't have said it better myself. Thanks for joining us on this exploration of self-discovery, resilience, and the search for meaning. We hope you keep reflecting on these themes and share your own insights. And remember, no matter where you are in your journey, never underestimate the power of remembering who you are.


**Follow-up:** As I approached the one-year anniversary of my hospitalization, I ordered new wristbands. This time, I added a tilde before and after the initials: ~ RWTFYA ~ (which I see now is a strikethrough in markdown? Ugh.). Anyway, with the world going gah gah over em dashes, I wanted to add a playful spin, so I chose the tilde. Maybe it will catch on? Anyway, I also ditched SIMMONS on the other side and went with ~ YCFTBOT ~ which is now a huge controversy in my own family, and for good reason. I had no idea what I would feel going through the one-year mark of panic attacks, ER visits/stays, and eventually a few days in a mental health facility. Would thinking too much about it trigger another episode? Was my medication working and still needed? I've been slowly trying to ween myself off most of my prescriptions. I'm down to 50mg per day of Sertraline from 100mg. I don't take the Hydroxozine anymore, and only the Propranolol as needed. And I stopped the Wellbutrin last November after having some episodes. It's May 27th, 2025, and I'm still wearing the wristband. I like it as a reminder. Nobody ever asks me about it. It's just there for me to feel, touch, know. I'm not saying it's working. But I'm also not not saying it's working. As for the tattoo? Yes, I do plan on getting it at some point when I once again have money to do those kinds of things. I'm 52, and while I should be out of the getting tattoos portion of my life, I'm still keen on collecting them. After all, you can't RWTFYA if you didn't build who you were in the first place. And that takes time and wisdom.
