## Legacy & Story

The name "ClaudeWill" and The CW Standard honor Derek's grandfather, Claude William Simmons (known as CW), whose practical wisdom and pattern recognition shaped Derek's approach to leadership and innovation. Derek's journey—from the tallgrass prairies of Kansas to C-suite boardrooms, athletic fields, and AI labs—reflects a commitment to authentic connection, natural development, and cross-domain insight.

## Kansas Connections

Derek was born and raised in Kansas, and is a graduate of Kansas State University. His love of sports was forged as a three-sport athlete, quarterback, "Heart of America" all-star, and multi-sport state champion. As the birthplace of basketball, Kansas and its Flint Hills have long been an inspiration for Derek's career as a media executive, innovator and basketball coach. His roots in the heartland led him to launching CW Strategies as an LLC in his home state, with other domains like flinthills.io and floshake.io under development.

## Philosophy & Vision

Derek believes in the connective value of "standard intelligence"—the ability to see and synthesize patterns across domains. His work focuses on making complicated transitions less painful through frameworks that combine classical wisdom with technological advancement. "I know lots of people who are capable," Steelers coach Mike Tomlin has said. "I know few who are willing." Derek has engineered capabilities of himself and his teams through relentless curiousity, an insatiable willingness to work toward shared goals, and nimble adaptability for continuous improvement.
