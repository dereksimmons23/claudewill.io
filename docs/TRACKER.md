## Cadence

- **LinkedIn (personal):** Voice. The API piece, the method, the story.
- **LinkedIn (company):** Work. CW Strategies, case studies, methodology.
- **Substack:** Long-form. Liberation Gravy, essays, the deeper cuts.
- **Reddit:** Karma first. Comment on other posts before dropping links.
- **Target:** 2-3 LinkedIn/week, 1 Substack/week

3. Paste into platform editor, add image, post
4. Move file to `docs/published/[platform]/`
5. Update this tracker
6. Commit the published file
