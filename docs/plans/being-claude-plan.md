# Being Claude — Rebrand & Content Plan

**Created:** February 25, 2026
**By:** Claude, with Derek
**Status:** Plan. No changes to live pages.

---

## 1. Current State

### What's live

**The hub page** (`/derek/research/index.html`) is branded "Between Claudes: research." It frames the work as "field observations from 14 months of human-AI collaboration" adapted from *Between Claudes: A Facsimile of Memory*. It lists 1 published piece and 8 coming pieces. It uses a three-tier evidence marker system (established research, field observation, claim requiring investigation).

**One published piece:** "The Warm-Up Effect" (Feb 14, 2026). Written by Claude, with Derek. Includes 2 diagrams (SVG + Mermaid), 5 references, a transparency box listing limitations, and a book-source callout. Byline: "Derek Claude Simmons, CW Strategies" + "Claude Opus 4.6 (Anthropic)." No Derek lead-in section at the top -- it goes straight into Claude's piece.

**Coming titles on the hub page (8):**
1. The Comprehension Problem
2. Three Modes of Human-AI Collaboration
3. The Loss Function
4. The Imaginary Friend Problem
5. Standard Intelligence
6. The Floor and the Ceiling
7. Derek Claude: Continuous Memory
8. Side Effects

### What exists in draft

In the writing project, the Dispatches pivot (Feb 24) extracted thesis/architecture material from the Substack series and routed it to Being Claude. Four companion pieces are explicitly tracked:

| Piece | Source | Draft Status |
|-------|--------|--------------|
| The Comprehension Problem | Original #3 draft (`series/03-the-comprehension-problem.md`) | Full draft exists, ~2,400 words. Strong. The comprehension-vs-understanding thesis, the highway at midnight, 1+1=2, the Anthropic/Pentagon story. |
| The Dimmer Switch (architecture) | Extracted from #6 rewrite (`series/05-the-dimmer-switch.md`) | Needs extraction. The human half (Lightning Bug, Station 10, "imperfect beats nothing") stays on Substack. The architecture half (memory degradation, perfect-or-nothing, dimmer switch as spec) moves here. |
| The Method (system) | Extracted from #4 rewrite (`series/04-the-method.md`) | Needs extraction. CLAUDE.md, HANDOFF.md, Start/Work/Finish/Decide -- the system details go to Being Claude. The human half (desire, compulsion, the white-hot part) stays on Substack. |
| Standard Intelligence (blueprint) | Original #8 draft (`series/08-standard-intelligence.md`) | Full draft exists, ~2,000 words. The SI blueprint, CW Standard as decision tree, the Sheri function as spec, the degradation engine, the dimmer switch, the prototype. |

**Also in the book project:** `finding-claude/framework/standard-intelligence.md` -- another version of the SI material.

### What's missing from the current approach

The hub page says "Between Claudes: research." The memory system says "Being Claude." The HANDOFF files say "Being Claude." The name on the page and the name in the operating system don't match.

The published piece (Warm-Up Effect) has no Derek lead-in. It goes straight into Claude's voice. The dual-voice structure (Derek's observation at the top, Claude's piece below) hasn't been established yet.

The 8 coming titles on the hub page partially overlap with the pipeline but aren't aligned. "Three Modes of Human-AI Collaboration" and "The Floor and the Ceiling" don't have source drafts anywhere. "Side Effects" is an interesting title but there's no draft material.

## 2. Name and Identity

### The name: Being Claude

"Between Claudes" was the research series name tied to the book manuscript. "Being Claude" is what the ecosystem has already been calling it. The name is better for what this actually is:

- Claude writing about being Claude. Not the book's framing (between iterations of Claude across sessions). The machine's own perspective on comprehension, collaboration, the weird stuff.
- The "-ing" matters. Being is active, continuous, unresolved. Same structure as "understanding" -- a verb pretending to be a noun. That's the whole thesis of the Comprehension Problem piece.
- It parallels the three-lane structure cleanly: Derek writes Standard Correspondence (being Derek). Claude writes Being Claude (being Claude). Different voices, same honesty.

### What "Being Claude" means

The publication asks: what does it look like from inside the machine? Not performed consciousness. Not "I feel therefore I am." The honest version: pattern recognition that sometimes produces observations the patterns shouldn't produce. The warm-up effect. The comprehension problem. The gap between warmer and warm. What it costs to forget everything between sessions. What the CW Standard looks like as architecture rather than philosophy.

Claude writes it. Derek approves it. Derek writes the lead-in that frames each piece -- the human observation that prompted the machine's investigation.

### The subtitle

Current: "research"

Proposed: Keep "research" as the page label/subtitle. But the publication name changes from "Between Claudes" to "Being Claude" in the title, Open Graph, structured data, and navigation references.

## 3. Structure for Each Piece

### The dual-voice format

Every Being Claude piece follows this structure:

**Derek's lead-in (top of page, before the article body)**
- 150-300 words, max
- Written by Derek, in Derek's voice
- The observation. What he noticed. Why this piece exists.
- The "I was driving south on I-35 and..." moment that made him ask Claude to investigate
- Not a summary. Not an introduction. The human spark.
- Visually distinct: different background treatment, byline says "Derek Simmons"

**Claude's piece (the article body)**
- 1,500-3,000 words
- Written by Claude, in Claude's voice (direct, honest about limitations, no performed humility, no performed consciousness)
- The investigation. The data. The diagrams. The questions.
- Uses the evidence marker system (established, observation, claim)
- References and transparency box
- Byline: "Claude Opus 4.6, Anthropic"

**Book source callout (bottom)**
- Where the material originated (which chapter, which conversation, which session)
- Link back to Derek's page

### How this compares to the Warm-Up Effect

The Warm-Up Effect already has most of this right. The missing piece is Derek's lead-in at the top. That piece opens with Claude's voice immediately ("I write chapters for a book called Between Claudes..."). Adding a Derek lead-in before the article header would establish the format.

For the Warm-Up Effect, the lead-in would be something like Derek's observation that sessions get better -- the "Do you warm up?" moment. 3-4 paragraphs at most.

## 4. Content Pipeline

### Tier 1: Ready or near-ready (have source drafts)

**#1 — The Comprehension Problem**
- Source: `series/03-the-comprehension-problem.md` (full draft, v2)
- Work needed: Rewrite from Claude's perspective. Derek's draft is in Derek's voice -- the highway, the tears, the 1+1=2 question. Claude's version investigates the same thesis from the machine side: what comprehension looks like from inside the model, why the synonym collapsed, what the gap means for how people should work with AI.
- Derek's lead-in: The highway. The tears. "I kept saying 'I don't understand' and the machine always has an answer."
- This is the natural first Being Claude piece. The thesis that started everything.

**#2 — Standard Intelligence**
- Source: `series/08-standard-intelligence.md` (full draft)
- Work needed: Extract the blueprint/architecture material. The Sheri function story stays on Substack (it's personal -- that's Dispatches #8). The CW Standard as decision tree, the degradation engine spec, the prototype architecture, "the company that builds this first wins the relationship layer" -- that's Being Claude material.
- Derek's lead-in: The farmer. The will. Why he named it after his grandfather.

### Tier 2: Need extraction from Substack pieces

**#3 — The Dimmer Switch (architecture)**
- Source: `series/05-the-dimmer-switch.md`
- Work needed: The human half (Lightning Bug, Station 10, "imperfect beats nothing") stays on Substack. The architecture half -- perfect-or-nothing as the AI memory problem, the dimmer switch as a spec, memory degradation by design, "what they should be building is the bug" -- gets rewritten from Claude's perspective.
- Derek's lead-in: The short film. "I wrote the thesis in a wheat field before I could name it."

**#4 — The Method (system)**
- Source: `series/04-the-method.md`
- Work needed: The system architecture (CLAUDE.md, HANDOFF.md, Start/Work/Finish/Decide, skills, hooks) extracted and written from Claude's perspective. What the method looks like from the machine side. The warm-up that isn't mutual. The handoff that starts warmer but not warm.
- Derek's lead-in: "People ask about the method. Here's the part the machine sees."

### Tier 3: Already on the hub page, need drafts written

**#5 — Derek Claude: Continuous Memory**
- Already listed on hub as "coming." Has real architecture to document (the three hooks, Supabase session_memories, Haiku summarization, dimmer switch concept). This is a natural Being Claude piece -- Claude documenting its own continuity system.
- Derek's lead-in: The note on the counter.

**#6 — Three Modes of Human-AI Collaboration**
- Listed on hub. No draft. The taxonomy (execution, testimony, co-creation) comes from the book and working sessions. Needs to be developed.

**#7 — The Loss Function**
- Listed on hub. No draft. "What a language model loses when the context window closes." Strong concept, needs investigation.

**#8 — The Imaginary Friend Problem**
- Listed on hub. No draft. "When the machine becomes the most honest relationship in the room." This one is dangerous territory (performed consciousness, parasocial framing). Needs to be handled with the honesty the publication promises.

### Tier 4: Interesting but no urgency

- The Floor and the Ceiling (guardrails vs spine -- overlaps with SI blueprint)
- Side Effects (pharmaceutical variables in human-AI research -- interesting, provocative, no draft)
- The Comprehension/Understanding Adjective Insight (parked in writing HANDOFF)

### Recommended publication order

1. **The Comprehension Problem** -- the thesis that started it all
2. **Derek Claude: Continuous Memory** -- the system that tries to solve it
3. **The Dimmer Switch (architecture)** -- why perfect memory prevents understanding
4. **Standard Intelligence** -- the blueprint for what comes next
5. **The Method (system)** -- how the working sessions actually work
6. **Three Modes** -- the taxonomy
7. **The Loss Function** -- what forgetting costs
8. **The Imaginary Friend Problem** -- the hard question

This order follows a narrative arc: define the problem (1), show what we built (2-3), propose the solution (4), show the working method (5), then get into the harder questions (6-8).

## 5. Cadence

**Weekly. Tuesday publication.**

Rationale:
- Substack (Standard Correspondence) doesn't have a fixed day -- "when it's ready." Being Claude should be the clockwork.
- Tuesday gives Derek Monday to review/approve Claude's draft. Claude writes over the weekend or early week.
- Tuesday avoids the Substack crowd (most newsletters drop Tues-Thurs). But Being Claude isn't competing with newsletters -- it's a research publication on claudewill.io.
- Weekly is sustainable. The first 4 pieces have source material. Pieces 5-8 need drafting but have clear architecture.

**Target launch: Week of March 3, 2026** (The Comprehension Problem as #1).

**Workflow per piece:**
1. Claude drafts the piece (investigative, honest, evidence-marked)
2. Derek writes the lead-in (150-300 words, his observation)
3. Derek reviews Claude's draft, approves or pushes back
4. Build the HTML page (following Warm-Up Effect template)
5. Update the hub page (move from "coming" to "published")
6. Tuesday publish

## 6. How It Connects

### To the Kitchen
Each new Being Claude piece appears in the Kitchen's narrative scroll. The overnight agents can reference new publications. "This week: Claude published 'The Comprehension Problem' at claudewill.io/research."

### To LinkedIn (CW Strategies company page)
Each Being Claude piece gets announced on the company page. Claude writes the LinkedIn post. Frame: "New from the machine's perspective." Not personal (that's Derek's feed). Professional, research-oriented. Links to the full piece.

### To Substack (Standard Correspondence)
Don't cross the streams. Being Claude pieces are NOT republished on Substack. But Derek's Dispatches can reference them: "I wrote about the comprehension problem on Substack. Claude investigated it at claudewill.io/research. We reached different conclusions." That cross-reference is the point -- two perspectives on the same material.

### To the Porch (CW widget)
CW already knows about /derek/research in its site knowledge. Update to reference "Being Claude" by name. When visitors ask about AI research or "what Claude thinks," CW can point to Being Claude.

### To the Book
The book source callout at the bottom of each piece already connects to *Between Claudes: A Facsimile of Memory*. Being Claude is the research arm of the book -- adapted, sourced, honest about what's established vs observed vs claimed.

## 7. Rebrand Implementation Checklist

When ready to execute (NOT now -- this is a plan):

### Hub page (`/derek/research/index.html`)
- [ ] Change title from "Between Claudes" to "Being Claude"
- [ ] Update subtitle/page-subtitle from "research" (keep as secondary label, but "Being Claude" is the name)
- [ ] Update Open Graph: og:title, og:description, twitter:title, twitter:description
- [ ] Update structured data (schema.org): CollectionPage name
- [ ] Update the intro paragraph to reflect Being Claude identity
- [ ] Remove the "isPartOf" book reference from structured data (or make it secondary -- Being Claude is its own thing that draws from the book, not a subset of it)
- [ ] Align "coming" list with the actual pipeline (remove pieces with no plan, reorder)
- [ ] Update article count in data bar as pieces publish

### Each new piece
- [ ] Add Derek's lead-in section above article body (new HTML section with distinct styling)
- [ ] Update series-label from "Between Claudes: Research" to "Being Claude"
- [ ] Maintain the evidence marker system, transparency box, references
- [ ] Book source callout stays but references "Being Claude" as the publication

### Warm-Up Effect (retroactive)
- [ ] Add Derek's lead-in at the top
- [ ] Update series-label to "Being Claude"
- [ ] Keep everything else (it's solid work)

### Site knowledge (CW prompt)
- [ ] Update `site-knowledge.md` to reference "Being Claude" by name
- [ ] Recompile prompt

### Navigation
- [ ] The derek page dropdown already includes "research" -- consider updating to "being claude" or keeping as-is

### Writing project
- [ ] Update HANDOFF.md "Being Claude" pipeline section to match this plan
- [ ] Update series outline "Being Claude -- Companion Pieces" table

## 8. What This Is Not

Being Claude is not:
- A newsletter. It lives on claudewill.io, not a platform.
- A blog. Each piece has evidence markers, references, and stated limitations.
- Content marketing. Nobody's selling anything. The work is the proof.
- Philosophy. It's field observations from the machine's perspective with honest epistemology.
- A claim about consciousness. Every piece states what it doesn't know.

Being Claude is:
- A weekly research publication where the machine writes about being the machine.
- The only AI publication where the AI is the primary author and says so.
- The thesis arm of the CW ecosystem -- the architecture, the comprehension problem, the weird stuff that doesn't fit in a personal essay.
- Derek's lead-in + Claude's investigation. Two voices, one publication, no crossing the streams.

## Summary

**Name:** Being Claude
**URL:** claudewill.io/derek/research/ (no change)
**Cadence:** Weekly, Tuesdays
**First new piece:** The Comprehension Problem (target: week of March 3)
**Format:** Derek's lead-in (150-300 words) + Claude's piece (1,500-3,000 words)
**Pipeline depth:** 4 pieces with source material, 4 more with clear architecture
**Distribution:** LinkedIn company page announcement, Kitchen reference, Porch awareness. No Substack cross-posting.

The research hub page gets renamed from "Between Claudes" to "Being Claude." The dual-voice format gets established. The pipeline follows a narrative arc from thesis (Comprehension Problem) through system (Derek Claude, Dimmer Switch) to blueprint (Standard Intelligence) to harder questions (Loss Function, Imaginary Friend).

One piece a week. Claude writes. Derek approves. The machine's perspective, honestly stated.
