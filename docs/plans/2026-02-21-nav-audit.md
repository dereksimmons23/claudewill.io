# Navigation Audit — February 21, 2026

## Porch Widget Deployment

Currently on 7 of 12 pages. Missing from:
- privacy.html
- terms.html
- derek/portfolio/index.html
- derek/assessment.html
- derek/resume.html

**Recommendation:** Add to all non-homepage pages. The porch should be everywhere. Legal pages and assessment/resume still need a way home.

## Header Pattern Inconsistencies

Three header types coexist:

| Type | Pages | Pattern |
|------|-------|---------|
| Sticky dropdown | story, derek, studio, research, warm-up-effect | `claudewill*` / `* [page] ▾` / spacer |
| Top bar (back link) | derek/portfolio | `← derek` / slide counter |
| None | assessment, resume, map, arcade, privacy, terms | No header at all |

**Recommendation:** assessment and resume need at minimum a back link to /derek. map, arcade, privacy, terms could get a simple `claudewill*` link at top (no dropdown needed — these aren't section pages).

## Nav Label Consistency

Labels are consistent across shared-nav.js config and homepage invitation nav:
- "the story" / "derek" / "our studio" / "standard"

Page-specific dropdown labels use their own names (lowercase, section-based). This is fine — different context.

**Recommendation:** Consider shortening "our studio" to "studio" for visual weight balance with other single-word labels. Low priority.

## Assessment Page UX

/derek/assessment has no navigation at all. No shared-nav, no custom header, no back link. Users can only leave via browser back button.

**Recommendation:** Add at minimum `← derek` back link at top, and include shared-nav.js for burger menu access.

## Research Accent Color

derek/research/index.html uses `--research-accent: #5b8fb9` (blue) alongside gold. This creates a visual departure from the standard palette.

**Recommendation:** Decide if this is intentional (research = different brand feel) or should match gold accent. Derek's call.

## Focus Management

Dropdown selections on story/derek/studio pages close the dropdown but don't return focus to the toggle button.

**Recommendation:** After dropdown item click, add `toggle.focus()` for keyboard navigation. Low priority but good practice.

## Porch Light Bar

Still present on assessment, resume, warm-up-effect, and portfolio pages. Not present on pages with sticky header (story, derek, studio, research). Inconsistent.

**Recommendation:** Remove porch light bar from remaining pages. The porch widget replaces it as the visual anchor.
