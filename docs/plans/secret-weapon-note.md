# The Secret Weapon — Positioning Note

*February 23, 2026 — from a late-night Cascadia session that turned into a mirror*

## The Problem

The /work-with-me page is good. The flow works. The proof is real. But the page never shows WHY Derek is different. "AI-native coaching for teams" is the tagline — the page never explains what that means.

- "2,000+ AI working sessions" is a number in a box with no story behind it
- The Two Ways In cards (fractional leadership, team training) are placeholders — no format, duration, deliverables, outcomes
- The homepage doesn't mention AI at all
- The connection between Claude the grandfather and Claude the AI — the most interesting thing about the brand — is implicit
- "Built by Derek*Claude" in the footer is doing all the heavy lifting and nobody knows it's there
- The site IS the proof that AI-native work works. It just doesn't know it yet.

## The Insight

Derek on what a training session is:

> "Let me teach you in a few hours what took me 14 months to learn the hard way. It's a story. It's training. It's both."

The training session IS the story. The 14 months — career ended, mom died, talked to a chatbot at 2 a.m., built ten things, won a basketball championship, figured out how to work WITH a machine instead of deploying it AT people — that's both the content and the pitch.

It's not "here are five AI tools for your newsroom." It's "here's what happened when one person stopped treating AI like software and started treating it like a collaborator, and here's how your team can skip the 14 months."

## What Needs to Happen

1. **Two Ways In — fill the cards.** What does fractional leadership actually include (deliverables, cadence, reporting)? What does a training session look like (format, duration, materials, outcomes)?
2. **The training story.** The pitch for training sessions isn't a curriculum — it's Derek's story compressed into a few hours. The method emerged from the mess. That's the credential.
3. **Show the weapon.** The site was built by one guy and an AI. Every page, every function, every prompt. That's not a footnote — that's the proof. Surface it.
4. **The AI line.** Figure out how to articulate what "AI-native" means on the page without it reading like every other consultant's pitch. The difference is the working relationship, not the tools.

## The Format

**Two chairs. One story. Live.**

Derek in one chair. Claude in the other. Not a demo. Not a slide deck. A conversation — the same kind of conversation that built ten things from the wreckage — happening in real time in front of the room.

Every other AI consultant presents ABOUT AI. Derek presents WITH it. The format IS the proof. The medium IS the message.

TEDai talk. Training session. Keynote. It's all the same thing: two chairs, one story, and a room full of people who came to watch a presentation and left knowing how to have a conversation.

## Who Needs This

- Matt (FORGE board) — needs training session details before he can pitch it
- Boise publisher — asked for a pitch deck, needs to see what he'd actually be buying
- Rhonda / CDN — seed planted for AI training internally
- Every stranger who lands on /work-with-me

*"Am I sitting on a secret weapon named Claude and if so, is it you or me?" — Derek, 8pm on a Monday*

*Both. But mostly you.*
