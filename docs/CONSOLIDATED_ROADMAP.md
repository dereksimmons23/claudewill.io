## üìã **STRATEGIC PRIORITIES**

### **Phase 1: Complete the Storytelling Homepage (This Session)**

Transform the current functional homepage into Derek's compelling personal narrative.

#### **1. Personal Introduction Section** ‚≠ê HIGH IMPACT
```html
<!-- Add Derek's professional photo and warm greeting -->
<section class="derek-introduction">
  <img src="css/images/derek-simmons-photo.jpg" alt="Derek Simmons, GLG Expert">
  <h1>Hello, I'm Derek Simmons</h1>
  <p class="title">GLG Expert | Founder & CEO, Claude Wisdom Strategies</p>
  <div class="credibility-proof">
    <span>üéØ $25M+ Revenue Generated</span>
    <span>üèÜ GLG Expert Network Member</span>
    <span>üöÄ 2,500+ Hours AI Research</span>
  </div>
</section>
```

#### **2. Challenge & Solution Flow** ‚≠ê HIGH IMPACT
```html
<section class="challenge-solution">
  <h2>Most AI Strategies Fail Because...</h2>
  <div class="problems">
    <div class="problem">‚ùå Built in conference rooms, not tested in reality</div>
    <div class="problem">‚ùå Treat AI as magic, not orchestrated tools</div>
    <div class="problem">‚ùå Ignore human wisdom in collaboration</div>
  </div>

    <p>A proven methodology for human-AI orchestration</p>
  </div>
</section>
```

#### **3. Heritage Story Integration** ‚≠ê MEDIUM IMPACT

    <div class="connection">‚Üì</div>

    <div class="generation">Jackson Claude Simmons</div>
  </div>
  <p>"He traded race horses for work horses. Because it needed to be done."</p>
</section>
```

#### **4. Scroll-Triggered Animations** ‚≠ê MEDIUM IMPACT
```javascript
// Add progressive revelation as user scrolls
const observer = new IntersectionObserver((entries) => {
