  transform: translateY(50px);
  transition: all 0.8s cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 0.2, 1);
}

.reveal-on-scroll.revealed {
  opacity: 1;
  transform: translateY(0);
}

/* Parallax sections */
.parallax-section {
  background-attachment: fixed;
  background-position: center;
  background-repeat: no-repeat;
  background-size: cover;
}
```

#### JavaScript Scroll Controller

```javascript
// Intersection Observer for scroll animations
const observerOptions = {
  threshold: 0.1,
  rootMargin: '0px 0px -50px 0px'
};

const observer = new IntersectionObserver((entries) => {
  entries.forEach(entry => {
    if (entry.isIntersecting) {
      entry.target.classList.add('revealed');
    }
  });

## **Deployment Strategy for This Afternoon**

### **Phase 1: Content Updates (1:30-2:30 PM)**
```bash
# Update homepage with new story structure
make story-deploy MSG="Implement Derek's storytelling homepage"
```

### **Phase 2: Visual Elements (2:30-3:30 PM)**
```bash
# Add Derek's photo and visual enhancements
make deploy MSG="Add professional photo and credibility elements"
```

### **Phase 3: Mobile Testing (3:30-4:00 PM)**

make test
# Final deployment
make deploy MSG="Launch Derek's story-driven homepage"
```

## **Questions for Final Polish**

1. **Photo Style**: Professional headshot or more casual/approachable?
2. **Color Emphasis**: Should we highlight the four-generation timeline in brand colors?
3. **CTA Placement**: Add a secondary CTA after the heritage section?
4. **Social Proof**: Include any client logos or testimonials in the credibility section?

Your edits have transformed this from a good consulting homepage into a compelling personal story that builds trust and demonstrates authenticity. The grandfather's story is particularly powerful ‚Äî it perfectly embodies The CW Standard philosophy of practical solutions over flashy presentation.

Ready to implement these refinements for this afternoon's deployment?
