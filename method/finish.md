# Finish

Leave it so tomorrow-you can pick it up cold.

## What This Is

The last thing you do in any session. You stop working and write down what happened. Not a diary entry. A handoff — to yourself, to a teammate, or to the next AI session that won't remember any of this.

## Why It Matters

AI sessions don't carry memory. Every conversation starts from zero. The state file is how you cheat that. Without it, you spend the first 30 minutes of every session re-explaining what you already did.

With it, you read one file and you're back.

## How It Works

### 1. What happened

List what you actually did. Not what you planned — what you did. Three to five bullets. Be specific enough to be useful, brief enough to actually read.

Good:
- Shipped the nav redesign prototype to Cynthia
- Fixed the mobile drawer bug (was a z-index issue)
- Decided to pass on custom typography ($2,231 too much for Year 1)

Bad:
- Worked on stuff
- Made progress on the project

### 2. What was decided

Decisions disappear if you don't write them down. Capture the call and the reasoning. Tomorrow-you will want to know why, not just what.

Good:
- Pass on custom type this year. Revisit for Year 2 if magazine gains momentum.

Bad:
- Typography decision made

### 3. What's next

The one or two things that matter for the next session. Not the backlog. Not the roadmap. Just: what would you tell someone walking in tomorrow morning?

### 4. What's open

Anything unresolved, waiting on someone else, or deliberately deferred. These are the things that will nag you at 2am if you don't write them down.

## Where It Lives

One file per project: `HANDOFF.md` at the project root.

New entries go at the top. Date them. Old entries stay — they're the record. If the file gets long, that's a sign the project is active, not a problem to solve.

## The Minimum

If you do nothing else, answer three questions:

1. What did I do?
2. What did I decide?
3. What's next?

Everything beyond that is polish. Those three keep the chain unbroken.
