# Work

Do the work together. That's the whole idea.

## What This Is

One human. One AI. A chat. The human sets direction. The AI executes. Both think.

It's not delegation. You don't hand off a task and come back for the result. You stay present. You react. You redirect. You catch the thing the AI won't catch because it doesn't know what you know.

It's not supervision. You're not checking the AI's homework. You're working alongside it, the way two people build a fence — one holds, one hammers, both decide where the next post goes.

## How It Works

### Set direction first

Before the AI writes a line of code or a paragraph of prose, say what you're trying to do and why. Not the implementation — the intent.

Bad: "Add a function that validates email input"
Good: "Users are submitting garbage in the contact form. Let's fix that."

The second one lets the AI think about the problem, not just the task.

### Stay present

Read what the AI produces. React immediately. Don't let it run for 20 steps before you look. The longer you wait, the further it drifts.

This is the difference between a chat and delegation. You're present.

### Course-correct early

If the direction is wrong after the first step, say so. "That's not what I meant" costs 10 seconds. Letting it finish costs 10 minutes and a rewrite.

### Know what you're good at

You bring: judgment, taste, context, relationships, lived experience, the thing that happened in the meeting that isn't in any document.

AI brings: speed, pattern recognition, tireless execution, memory of every file it's read, no ego about being redirected.

Use both.

## The Modes

Not every session is the same kind of work.

**Building:** You describe what users need. AI writes the code. You test it, feel it, say what's off. AI adjusts. Ship when it's right.

**Writing:** You provide the raw material — testimony, notes, memories, voice memos. AI helps shape it without replacing your voice. You read it aloud. If it doesn't sound like you, it goes back.

**Pitching:** You know the client and the stakes. AI helps structure the argument, find the data, draft the deliverable. You add the judgment calls and the things only you know about the relationship.

## What Goes Wrong

**You disappear.** You hand the AI a task and go do something else. It produces 500 lines that solve the wrong problem. Fix: stay in the room.

**You micromanage.** You dictate every line and the AI becomes a fancy autocomplete. Fix: set direction, then let it run one step at a time.

**You skip the intent.** You say what to build but not why. The AI can't make judgment calls without context. Fix: always start with the problem, not the solution.

**You go too long.** Four hours of working together produces worse work than two hours. Your judgment degrades. Fix: take breaks. The AI doesn't need them. You do.
