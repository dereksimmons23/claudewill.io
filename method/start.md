# Start

Know where you are before you move.

## What This Is

The first thing you do in any session. Before writing code, before opening a draft, before reviewing a deliverable. You read the state, surface what matters, and decide what you're doing today.

## How It Works

### 1. Read the state file

Every project has a HANDOFF.md. It's what yesterday-you left for today-you. Read it.

If there's no state file, you're starting fresh. That's fine. Write one at the end.

### 2. Check what's live

If something is deployed, running, or visible to other people — check that it still works. Don't assume. Takes 30 seconds.

### 3. Name the priority

One thing. Not three. What would make today count?

If you can't pick one, the work isn't clear yet. That's a decision problem, not a planning problem. Use `decide.md`.

### 4. Say it out loud

Tell your AI partner what you're working on and why. Not the task list — the intent. "I need to finish the assessment pre-read because it determines whether the client stays." Context makes the work better.

## What This Looks Like

**Building:** Read HANDOFF.md. Check the live site. Pick the feature or fix. Say why it matters.

**Writing:** Read HANDOFF.md. Reread the last thing you wrote. Pick the chapter or piece. Say where you are emotionally — it affects voice.

**Pitching:** Read the deliverable tracker. Check deadlines. Pick the one that moves money or trust. Say what's at stake.

## The Ritual

Some projects have a name for this. `/standup`, `/sss`, whatever. The name doesn't matter. The practice does:

**Read. Check. Pick. Say.**

If you do those four things, the session has a spine. If you skip them, you'll be 45 minutes in before you realize you're working on the wrong thing.
