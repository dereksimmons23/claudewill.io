Shared ledger across projects. Check before writing. Log after publishing.

## Platforms

| | | | |

## Queued

| Target | Platform | Topic | Status |
|--------|----------|-------|--------|
| Post-Feb 13 | LinkedIn | Naming Things Is Infrastructure | Idea parked, write after CDN mid-term |
| TBD | Substack | Personal version of naming piece | Different angle, same insight |
| This week | LinkedIn | Countup posts (recalibrate from daily to 2-3x/week) | 10 drafts exist, need voice check post-roast |
| TBD | LinkedIn | The Artificial Return (AROI) | Draft ready. Three ROIs: investment, intelligence, illusion. `claudewill.io/docs/drafts/linkedin/` |

## Rules

- LinkedIn and Substack don't publish the same piece. Different voice, different audience.
- Both drive traffic to claudewill.io.
- Log everything here so you're not guessing across tabs.
