# How To

This is a practice for getting work done with AI. Building, writing, pitching — doesn't matter. The method is the same.

It came from 22,000 messages across 8 projects in 32 days. Not theory. Just what worked when the theory was stripped away.

## The Method

1. **Start** — Know where you are. Read the state. Ask what matters today.
2. **Work** — Do it together. Human sets direction, AI executes, both think.
3. **Finish** — Leave it clean. Write down what happened so tomorrow-you can pick it up cold.
4. **Decide** — When it's not obvious, look from more than one angle.

That's it.

## The Standard

Five principles. They don't change based on what you're working on.

1. **Truth over comfort** — Say what's real, not what's easy to hear.
2. **Usefulness over purity** — Does it help someone today? Then ship it.
3. **Transparency over reputation** — Show the work, including where it's ugly.
4. **People over systems** — If the process hurts the person, fix the process.
5. **Agency over ideology** — Help people think, not tell them what to think.

## The Docs

| Doc | What it covers |
|-----|---------------|
| `start.md` | How to show up. The morning ritual. |
| `work.md` | How to do the work. The chat. |
| `finish.md` | How to leave it clean. Handoffs. |
| `decide.md` | How to see clearly. Four lenses. |
| `content-structure.md` | How content moves from draft to published. |
| `nomenclature.md` | What everything is called. One name per thing. |
| `content-calendar.md` | Shared ledger across platforms. |

## The Templates

| Template | What it's for |
|----------|--------------|
| `CLAUDE-template.md` | Drop into any new project. Identity, boundaries, architecture. |
| `HANDOFF-template.md` | State file. What happened, what's next. |
| `SKILL-template.md` | Reusable workflow. One action, one file. |

## Where This Came From

CW Strategies. Named after Claude William Simmons (1903-1967). Depression-era Oklahoma farmer who raised a family on borrowed land and never once called it a methodology.

He just showed up, did the work, and left it better than he found it.
