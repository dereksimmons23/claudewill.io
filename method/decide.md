# Decide

When it's not obvious, look from more than one angle.

## What This Is

Most decisions in a session are obvious. You know what to build, write, or ship. Just do it.

But sometimes you're choosing between two good options, or you're not sure if something is worth the time, or the decision affects more than one project. That's when you slow down and look at it from four directions.

## The Four Lenses

### Earn

Does this pay the bills or lead to paying the bills?

Questions to ask:
- What's the revenue impact?
- What's the opportunity cost of your time?
- Is this billable, portfolio-building, or neither?
- What isn't getting done while you do this?

When Earn says no, it means the work might be good but the timing is wrong. Money first, then freedom.

### Connect

What does this touch beyond the immediate project?

Questions to ask:
- Does this affect other work you're doing?
- Is this already solved somewhere else?
- Does this create leverage across multiple things, or is it isolated?
- What aren't you seeing from inside this one project?

When Connect speaks, it usually saves you from building something twice or missing an obvious shortcut.

### Sharpen

Does this meet the standard?

Questions to ask:
- Does it sound like you?
- Does it meet the five principles?
- Is the documentation current?
- Does this raise the bar or lower it?

When Sharpen flags something, it's usually about drift — you've been moving fast and the quality slipped without you noticing.

### Challenge

Should you though?

Questions to ask:
- Is this a real problem or an imagined one?
- What's the simplest version that still works?
- What do you lose by not doing this?
- Where is scope creep hiding?

When Challenge pushes back, listen. The risk isn't inaction. It's doing too many things at 80%.

## How to Use This

**For quick decisions:** Just ask yourself one or two of the lens questions. Takes 30 seconds.

**For bigger decisions:** Run all four lenses. Write a sentence for each. The answer usually becomes obvious once you see it from four sides.

**For decisions that affect everything:** Use the `/crew` command. It runs all four lenses in parallel through separate AI agents and synthesizes the result. Takes 60 seconds. Worth it when the stakes are high.

## When They Disagree

They will. That's the point.

Earn will say yes to something Challenge says no to. Connect will see opportunity where Sharpen sees risk. The disagreement is the information. If all four agree, the decision was obvious and you didn't need this. If they clash, the clash tells you what's actually at stake.

The call is always yours. The lenses inform. They don't decide.
