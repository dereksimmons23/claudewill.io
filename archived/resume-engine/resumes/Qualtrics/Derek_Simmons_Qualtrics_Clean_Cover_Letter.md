**Qualtrics Hiring Team**  
**Re: AI Innovation Evangelist - Edge Team**

The opportunity to join Qualtrics Edge as a founding team member for AI innovation strategy represents exactly the type of transformative challenge that energizes me most. Your mission to "connect the dots between what consumers think and how they act" aligns perfectly with my 15+ years of experience generating $20M+ in revenue through cross-domain pattern recognition and AI-powered strategic frameworks.

## Why This Role Fits My Background Perfectly

**AI Thought Leadership & Market Intelligence**: Through 2,500+ hours of hands-on AI research, I've developed deep market intelligence across platforms, competitive landscapes, and emerging trends. My Walking Compass research series documents systematic methodologies for AI collaboration that organizations can implement immediately — exactly the type of thought leadership content that positions Qualtrics Edge as the innovation leader in experience management.

**Enterprise Sales Enablement Through AI**: At Star Tribune Media, I created the SalesGPT solution that reclaimed 2.5 work-years annually for sales operations, directly supporting enterprise sales team effectiveness. This experience taught me how to translate AI capabilities into practical sales enablement tools that generate measurable business value — a skill directly applicable to supporting your enterprise sales and marketing teams.

**Strategic Consulting with Documented Results**: My track record includes comprehensive AI strategic planning that resulted in enterprise-wide AI Task Forces, $5M+ in incremental revenue generation, and systematic transformation of organizational capabilities. This consulting experience, combined with C-level engagement skills, positions me to guide product development and support strategic client engagements.

## What I Bring to Qualtrics Edge

**Cross-Industry Pattern Recognition**: My unique background spans media transformation, AI strategy, and organizational change management. This cross-domain expertise enables me to identify AI applications and market opportunities that industry specialists might miss — exactly what's needed to differentiate Qualtrics Edge in a competitive landscape.

**Systematic Innovation Methodology**: I've pioneered The CW Standard framework for ethical AI implementation, demonstrating my ability to create reusable methodologies that organizations can adopt systematically. This aligns perfectly with your need for "reusable industry-focused assets for internal go-to-market teams."

**Revenue Generation Through Thought Leadership**: My Media Franchise Model generated $15M+ in revenue by creating new product categories and market positioning — precisely the type of innovative thinking needed to build excitement around Edge offerings and achieve subscription revenue targets.

## Strategic Vision for the Role

**Building Market-Differentiating Thought Leadership**: I see tremendous opportunity to position Qualtrics Edge as the definitive voice in AI-powered experience management through systematic content creation, strategic speaking engagements, and innovative research partnerships.

**Connecting Consumer Psychology with AI Capabilities**: My background in media and audience psychology, combined with deep AI technical knowledge, enables unique insights into how AI can predict consumer behavior — directly supporting your mission to predict "what they might do next."

**Scaling Strategic Impact**: As a founding team member, I'm excited about the potential to build frameworks and methodologies that become the foundation for Qualtrics Edge's long-term competitive advantage in AI-powered experience management.

The convergence of my AI expertise, strategic consulting background, and proven ability to generate thought leadership that drives revenue makes this an exceptional strategic fit. I'm particularly drawn to the opportunity to help establish Qualtrics Edge as the innovation leader in AI-powered experience management while building something significant as part of the founding team.

I'd welcome the opportunity to discuss how my systematic approach to AI strategy and thought leadership development can contribute to Qualtrics Edge's aggressive growth objectives.
