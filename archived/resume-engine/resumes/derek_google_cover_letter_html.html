            <strong>Re: Global Product Lead, Support Tools, Artificial Intelligence</strong>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="content">
        <div class="paragraph">
            Google built the foundational technology that powers every major AI system in use today, yet when people think AI, they don't think Google first. That's a strategic challenge I understand deeply from 27 years of helping organizations navigate technological transformation while competitors captured mindshare using your innovations.
        </div>

        <div class="paragraph">
            My background spans the intersection of systematic AI research, enterprise implementation, and cross-industry pattern recognition. Through 2,500+ hours of hands-on AI collaboration research, I've developed practical frameworks for human-AI integration that generate measurable business value. At Star Tribune Media, I led enterprise-wide AI transformation initiatives, including the SalesGPT automation platform designed to reclaim 2.5 work-years annually for sales operations.
        </div>

        <div class="section-header">Cross-Industry AI Expertise for Support Tools Innovation</div>

        <div class="paragraph">
            The Global Product Lead role requires someone who can translate ambiguous business requirements into systematic solutions across diverse user contexts. My experience implementing AI across media, consulting, and product development provides the cross-domain perspective essential for building support tools that enhance productivity rather than add complexity.
        </div>

        <div class="paragraph">
            I bring proven experience managing complex technical projects across multiple stakeholder groups, evidenced by my leadership of enterprise-wide AI Task Forces and strategic vendor relationships with AWS, Cohere, and SAP. This background in AI platform orchestration translates directly to developing Google's business tools ecosystem with the systematic approach your team needs.
        </div>

        <div class="section-header">Systematic Methodology for Ambiguous Problems</div>

        <div class="paragraph">
            Your job description emphasizes "investigative and tactical change agents" who can solve "significant and unique problems without clear precedent." This describes exactly the systematic research methodology I've developed through my Walking Compass research series and The CW Standard framework for ethical AI implementation.
        </div>

        <div class="paragraph">
            My approach to AI strategy development involves systematic testing, pattern recognition across seemingly unrelated domains, and building reusable frameworks that scale across organizations. I've applied this methodology to everything from media transformation challenges to AI security research through HackerOne red-teaming initiatives.
        </div>

        <div class="section-header">Strategic Vision for Google's AI Positioning</div>

        <div class="paragraph">
            Google's challenge isn't technological capability â€” you invented the transformer architecture that enables modern AI. The opportunity lies in building AI-powered support tools that showcase Google's innovation leadership while solving real workflow problems for enterprise users.
        </div>

        <div class="paragraph">
            My experience with enterprise AI implementation provides insights into what business tools actually need: systematic integration that enhances human judgment rather than replacing decision-making capabilities. This human-centered approach aligns with Google's innovation culture while addressing the practical challenges your enterprise clients face.
        </div>

        <div class="section-header">Location and Availability</div>

        <div class="paragraph">
            Currently based in Minnesota with strong preference for Google's Chicago office location, I bring both local market understanding and enterprise-scale AI expertise to support Google's continued market leadership in business tools innovation. Ready to contribute immediately to systematic support tools development and cross-functional collaboration.
        </div>

        <div class="paragraph">
            The convergence of my systematic AI research methodology, enterprise implementation experience, and cross-industry pattern recognition provides exactly the perspective needed to accelerate Google's support tools ecosystem development. I'm particularly drawn to the opportunity to help Google reclaim the AI innovation narrative while building business tools that demonstrate the practical value of your foundational technology.
        </div>

        <div class="paragraph">
            I'd welcome the opportunity to discuss how my systematic approach to complex problem-solving and proven AI implementation expertise can contribute to Google's vision for transforming enterprise productivity through intelligent support tools.
