- A personal color palette with meaningful connections to Derek's life journey
- Responsive design that works well across all devices
- Accessible light/dark mode toggle respecting user preferences

Each color in the palette connects to a meaningful story or concept:

- **Cottonwood**
- **Gunmetal Firebird**

## Development Process

### Design System Creation
We began by establishing a comprehensive design system including color palette, typography, and component styles to ensure a consistent visual language throughout the site.

### Conversational Interface Development
The Claude Will conversational interface was developed to demonstrate the concept of cross-domain pattern recognition, helping users explore connections between seemingly unrelated areas.

### Content Organization
Content was organized to highlight cross-domain connections - a core principle of The CW Standard. We structured information to reveal patterns between coaching philosophy, media transformation, and technological implementation.

## Technology Stack

claudewill.io was built with simplicity and performance in mind:

- HTML5 for semantic structure
- CSS3 with custom properties for theming
- Vanilla JavaScript for interactivity
- No frameworks or build tools

This approach keeps the site lightweight, fast-loading, and easy to maintain while still providing a modern, responsive experience.

## Claude Will Development

The conversational interface was designed to embody the principles it discusses:

- Responses showcase connections between coaching philosophy, media transformation, and technological implementation
- Interface design enhances human capability rather than replacing it
- Pattern recognition across domains is demonstrated through conversational exploration

The "i/o, i/o, it's off to work I go!" loading message is an Easter egg that blends technical terminology (Input/Output) with cultural references (Snow White's dwarfs) - another example of cross-domain connection.
