## Introduction

**Claude Will** is both a human-centered philosophy and a next-generation AI agent/knowledge platform. Rooted in the legacy of Claude William Simmons and the "RWTFYA" standard, Claude Will blends human wisdom, strategic curiosity, and machine intelligence to empower creative doers, leaders, and teams.

## Mission

Empower individuals and organizations to unlock insight, resilience, and authentic impact by connecting knowledge, values, and action—one meaningful project at a time, with the support of both human and AI intelligence.

## Vision

A world where people and organizations remember who they are, stay strategically curious, and continuously adapt—leveraging both human and artificial intelligence to create value, meaning, and positive change.

## Core Values

- **Authenticity:** Show up as your true self, in work and life.
- **Resilience:** Embrace setbacks as fuel for growth and innovation.
- **Curiosity:** Ask better questions, seek deeper understanding, and connect the dots.
- **Integrity:** Do the right thing, even when it’s hard.
- **Continuous Improvement:** Always iterate, learn, and evolve.
- **Generosity:** Share knowledge, support others, and build community.

## Strategic Pillars

1. **RWTFYA (Remember Who The F*ck You Are):** The foundation—self-awareness, legacy, and purpose.
2. **Strategic Curiosity:** The engine—explore, question, and anticipate change.
3. **Continuous Innovation:** The method—experiment, learn, and adapt in cycles, with both human and AI input.
4. **Connection:** The multiplier—build bridges between people, ideas, disciplines, and intelligent systems.

## Roadmap

### MVP (May–July 2025)

- Process 500–1,000 markdown files into a searchable, explorable knowledge base.
- Develop and deploy the Claude Will agent (Electron.js, Python, SQLite, ChromaDB, React, Anthropic Claude API).
- Test with real users and gather feedback.

### Continuous Innovation / Continuous Deployment

- Weekly/biweekly updates based on user feedback and new insights.
- Expand features: knowledge graph, multi-model AI querying, advanced search.
- Open up for alpha/beta testers and community contributions.

### Long-Term

- Evolve into a living platform for consulting, thought leadership, and community learning.
- Integrate new tools, frameworks, and collaborative features.
- Advance the Claude Will agent’s capabilities and value alignment.

## Success Metrics

- > 90% file processing success
  >
- Relevant results in top 5 hits for >80% of queries
- Discover at least 10 non-obvious connections
- Time savings of >30 minutes per research task
- 75% successful answers to natural language queries

## Key Risks & Mitigations

- **Technical complexity:** Start simple, use libraries, consider partners
- **Performance:** Start with subset, optimize iteratively
- **API costs:** Rate limit, cache, optimize prompts
- **Scope creep:** Rigid MVP, milestone reviews
- **File format issues:** Start with markdown, robust error handling
- **AI alignment:** Leverage constitutional AI principles and user feedback
