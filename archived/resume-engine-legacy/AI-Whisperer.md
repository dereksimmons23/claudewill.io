# AI Whisperer Market Analysis 2025: Strategic Positioning Insights for Derek Simmons

The AI Whisperer market represents a compelling but evolving opportunity for Derek's AI strategy consulting business. **The field is transitioning from standalone technical roles to strategic human-centric implementation positions**, creating significant opportunities for professionals with Derek's unique background in media, cross-domain pattern recognition, and human-centered AI ethics.

## Market demand shows strategic evolution rather than saturation

The AI Whisperer market is experiencing a critical transition in 2025. While dedicated "AI Whisperer" job postings have declined from their 2023 peak (down from 144 per million job searches to 20-30 per million), **the underlying skills are becoming embedded across roles rather than disappearing**.

This shift actually creates **competitive advantages for experienced practitioners** who can position themselves as strategic advisors rather than technical specialists.

## Companies prioritize communication and human-centered approaches

Research reveals that companies show a **60-40 preference for communication skills over purely technical abilities** when hiring AI Whisperers.
