## Strategy Business Partner, Applied AI

Dear Anthropic Hiring Team,

I am excited to apply for the Strategy Business Partner, Applied AI role. My background as an executive leader in AI strategy, digital transformation, and ethical innovation aligns deeply with Anthropic’s mission to build safe, responsible AI.

At Star Tribune Media, I led the company’s first AI Task Force and drove enterprise-wide adoption of LLMs and automation, generating $20M in new revenue and building high-performing, cross-functional teams. I have extensive experience translating complex AI concepts into actionable business strategy, optimizing operations, and ensuring technology amplifies—rather than replaces—human potential.

My work as founder of Claude Wisdom Strategies and as an independent AI consultant has focused on developing frameworks for responsible AI, supporting startups, and collaborating with global partners to advance safe, ethical technology. I thrive in environments where strategic thinking, operational rigor, and human-centered values intersect.

Anthropic’s commitment to responsible AI and operational excellence resonates strongly with my own. I would welcome the opportunity to help shape your Applied AI strategy, drive cross-team alignment, and support Anthropic’s mission at scale.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,  
Derek Simmons
