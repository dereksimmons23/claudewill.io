**Mayo Clinic**
**Program Success Manager Position**

Dear Hiring Manager,

My recent experience navigating healthcare systems as a caregiver for my elderly mother has given me firsthand insight into the patient and family perspective that I believe would enhance my approach to program management at Mayo Clinic. This personal connection to healthcare delivery, combined with my 15+ years of leading complex organizational transformations, positions me to drive meaningful impact in your mission of providing exceptional patient care.

As Executive Director at Star Tribune Media, I led enterprise-wide initiatives impacting 1,000+ employees, including the development of our first AI Task Force and implementation of automation solutions that reclaimed 2.5 work-years annually. My experience directing cross-departmental product development and establishing cohesive implementation standards across multiple platforms directly aligns with the stakeholder management and process optimization central to program success management. I've generated $20M+ in revenue through strategic innovation while maintaining operational excellence across diverse teams and competing priorities.

What I would bring to Mayo Clinic is a unique ability to translate between specialist domains and create frameworks that scale across complex organizational structures. My background bridging technology innovation with human-centered principles ensures that program implementations enhance rather than complicate the patient experience. I'm particularly drawn to Mayo Clinic's commitment to both clinical excellence and innovation, and I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my cross-domain leadership experience can contribute to your continued transformation in healthcare delivery.

Thank you for your consideration. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss how my proven track record of program leadership and personal understanding of healthcare's human impact can serve Mayo Clinic's mission.

Sincerely,
Derek Simmons
