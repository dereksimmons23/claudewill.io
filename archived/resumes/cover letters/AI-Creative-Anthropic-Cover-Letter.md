Dear Anthropic Hiring Team,

I am thrilled to apply for the Operations Lead, Creative Brand Studio role. My career has centered on building and scaling creative teams that deliver breakthrough brand experiences at the intersection of technology and storytelling. As Chief Creative Officer and Executive Director of New Products at Star Tribune Media, I built a 60-person studio, launched 20+ digital products, and generated $20M in new revenue—all while establishing operational systems that balanced creative ambition with disciplined execution.

I thrive in fast-paced, high-growth environments where creative excellence and operational rigor go hand in hand. My experience spans rebranding, digital transformation, and AI-driven innovation, including leading the SalesGPT automation initiative and pioneering new workflows for high-volume creative output. I am passionate about fostering cultures where creativity, accountability, and ethical technology drive impact.

Anthropic’s mission to build safe, responsible AI—and to communicate that vision with clarity and imagination—resonates deeply with me. I would be honored to help shape your Creative Brand Studio, build world-class teams, and deliver work that inspires and informs at global scale.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,  
Derek Simmons
