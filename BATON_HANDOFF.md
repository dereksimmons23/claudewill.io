## ðŸš© May 20, 2025 Update: Navigation & Documentation Structure

- **Navigation Modernization:**
  - Main navigation (header) now includes: Home, About Derek, Projects, Resume, Documentation.
  - Footer now includes: Documentation, About Derek, Privacy Policy, Terms of Use (with direct anchor links to documentation.html).
  - Security, Punch List, and Baton Handoff are accessible from the Documentation hub, not surfaced in main nav or footer for clarity and simplicity.
- **Documentation Hub:**
  - `/documentation.html` now serves as the single entry point for all technical, policy, and strategic docs.
  - Summaries and inline content from PRIVACY.md, TERMS.md, PUNCH_LIST.md, and BATON_HANDOFF.md are included for quick reference.
  - "How We Built This" is now the first section of documentation.html, preserving project story and design philosophy.
- **Best Practices:**
  - Navigation and documentation structure follow modern web and documentation best practices for clarity, usability, and SEO.
  - Footer links provide direct access to legal and policy info, while Documentation centralizes all project knowledge.

*This update reflects the navigation and documentation improvements as of May 20, 2025. See documentation.html for details.*
