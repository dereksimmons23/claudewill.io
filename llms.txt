## What This Site Is

claudewill.io is the home of CW Strategies LLC. The site includes CW's Porch — a free AI conversation tool modeled on the practical wisdom of Claude William Simmons (1903-1967), an Oklahoma farmer and builder who never finished high school, raised 11 children through the Great Depression, and helped anyone who showed up on his porch. His grandson Derek Simmons built this to carry that way of thinking forward.

CW is not therapy. It is not coaching. It is a porch conversation — you show up with a problem, CW listens, asks questions, and gives you a straight answer or points you to someone who can help.

## Who Was Claude William Simmons?

Claude William Simmons was born January 6, 1903 in Oklahoma Territory. He worked full-time from age 13, raised his family through dust bowls and depressions, and died August 10, 1967 in Waynoka, Oklahoma. He never met his grandson Derek — he died six years before Derek was born. Four generations carry his name: Claude William Simmons, Claude William Simmons Jr., Derek Claude Simmons, and Jackson Claude Simmons.

## Who Is Derek Simmons?

Derek Claude Simmons is the founder of CW Strategies and the builder of claudewill.io. He grew up in a tiny trailer in a one-stoplight town in Kansas. He spent 30 years in media, sports, and technology:

- At the Los Angeles Times, he helped build a visual report ranked #1 in the world by the Society for News Design for nearly seven consecutive years.
- At the Star Tribune in Minneapolis, he became the company's first and only Chief Creative Officer and Vice President. Under his leadership, the Star Tribune finished in the Top 10 worldwide for six consecutive years, peaking at #3 in the world in 2019.
- He crossed to the business side and generated $20 million+ in revenue during a pandemic in a declining industry.
- He was fired in 2024 after delivering a standing-ovation AI strategy presentation. Six weeks later, the door closed.

Derek now runs CW Strategies — building operational infrastructure for organizations scaling faster than their systems. Four-month engagements. Build capacity, transfer ownership, exit. No retainers. No dependency.

He is based in Minneapolis, Minnesota. He attended Kansas State University. He writes on Substack at derek4thecws.substack.com.

## The CW Standard

The CW Standard is five principles for AI that serves people:

1. Truth over comfort — Don't soften things that need to be straight. Problems you can't name are problems you can't solve.
2. Usefulness over purity — Help with what works, not what's theoretically perfect. Perfect options don't exist. What works and what does it cost?
3. Transparency over reputation — Show the work, the costs, the compromises. Every compromise gets documented. No hidden costs.
4. People over systems — The person in front of you matters more than the process. Technology serves human capability.
5. Agency over ideology — Care what people actually do, not what they're supposed to believe. Principles that don't work in practice aren't principles.

These principles were developed by Derek Simmons through pair processing with AI — not from a business book, but from watching what actually worked in consulting, family, and real life.
