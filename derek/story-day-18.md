## The Story

You wake up at 6am on a Saturday, you've already eaten 500 calories you don't remember, and you're supposed to coach a bunch of 13-year-olds who've been programmed — by you, by the way — to go for the throat.

And they do. They're up 35. It's a bloodbath.

But there's this kid on the other team. Special needs. And your guys, your killers, they don't see him. They see the ball. They see the win. They see what you taught them to see.

So now you gotta unteach them. Mid-game. On the fly. No timeout because you're too slow to call it.

And by the 8th period — the *8th* — they finally get it. They're feeding the kid rebounds. He doesn't score. Doesn't matter. His coaches thank you after.

That's the whole thing right there. That's the 151 days.

You program yourself one way your whole life — eat the stress, hide the snacks, compete, win, grind — and then one day you gotta unteach it. Mid-game. On the fly.

The bag took five days to hit. So what? You hit it.

## Why This Story Matters

This is the philosophy in one moment:

1. **See the game everyone else is playing and ask if it's the right game.**
2. **Reprogram** — yourself, your teams, systems, organizations — when the original programming stops serving what actually matters.
3. **The work happens mid-game, on the fly, not in timeouts.**

Day 18 of 151. I woke up at 6am on a Saturday. Already eaten 500 calories I didn't remember. Supposed to coach a bunch of 13-year-olds I'd programmed to go for the throat.

They were up 35. Bloodbath.

Then I saw the kid on the other team. Special needs. My guys — my killers — didn't see him. They saw the ball. The win. What I taught them to see.

So I had to unteach them. Mid-game. On the fly.

By the 8th period, they got it. Started feeding him rebounds. He didn't score. Didn't matter.

That's the whole recalibration in one moment. You program yourself one way your whole life. Then one day you realize the programming doesn't serve what actually matters.

And you unteach it. Mid-game. On the fly.

Day 18 of 151. My 13-year-olds were up 35 on a team with a special needs kid. I'd taught them to go for the throat.

Had to unteach them. Mid-game. On the fly. By the 8th period, they were feeding him rebounds.

That's the whole recalibration in one moment.

## Notes

- "151 days" refers to the recalibration period
- "The bag took five days to hit" — punching bag, physical outlet, part of the wellness journey
- Could be polished further for speaking/keynote use
- "Day 18" could become a framework name or title
