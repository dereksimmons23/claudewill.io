## Case Study 1: CDN / Cascadia Life Magazine

**Client:** Cascadia Daily News / Cascadia Life Magazine
**Role:** Strategic Consultant
**Period:** 2025-2026

### The Challenge

A regional media organization launching a new magazine product while navigating technology transitions, team dynamics, and budget constraints.

### The Approach

- **Collaborative synthesis** — Facilitated content decisions without dictating; let internal voices lead
- **Cross-functional support** — Contributed beyond core scope: budget decisions (HubSpot renewal saving $18K), technology choices (Seoul Graphics audit, Beehive evaluation)
- **Practical partnership** — Handled logistics, planned on-site visits, maintained communication bridges

### The Validation

> "Thank God you're a team player, Derek. It's so rare. It's so great working with you and Rhonda. I'm not used to a team. It freaks me out."
> — Cynthia, CDN

### The Takeaway

Consulting isn't about being the smartest person in the room. It's about becoming what the team needs — and earning trust by showing up differently than expected.
