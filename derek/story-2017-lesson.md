## The Insight

Never ask for a title that doesn't exist. If they didn't think of it, they don't know what it is. It will only exist on paper.

## The Story

In 2017, I traded a real role for a title that only existed in my head and on a business card.

The organization didn't build the role — I did. I defined it. I shaped it. I made it up as I went.

And when you're the only one who knows what the job is, you're not supported. You're alone.

The title looked great. The work was invisible.

## The Application

When evaluating a new role, ask:

1. **"Did they create this position intentionally, or are they guessing?"**
   - If they're guessing, that's not automatically bad — but you need to know.

2. **"What made you decide to create this position now?"**
   - Listen for specificity. Vague answers = vague role.

3. **"What problem are you solving that you couldn't solve before?"**
   - If they can't articulate it, they don't know what they're hiring for.

The 2017 lesson I'll never forget:

Never ask for a title that doesn't exist.

If they didn't think of it, they don't know what it is. It will only exist on paper.

I traded a real role for a title that only existed in my head and on a business card. The org didn't build the role — I did. And when you're the only one who knows what the job is, you're not supported.

You're alone.

Now when I evaluate roles — mine or my clients' — I ask:

"Did they create this position intentionally, or are they guessing?"

The answer changes everything.

## Notes

- This is a scar story — vulnerability without self-pity
- Connects to the "Title vs. Role" assessment in Recalibrate
- Could pair with "The Drought" (8 years since feeling supported)
