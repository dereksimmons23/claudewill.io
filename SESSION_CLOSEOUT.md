- ✅ Traffic problem is existential (~355 conversations, mostly testing)
- ✅ Probability: 35% current trajectory, 65% with distribution focus
- ✅ Recommendation: "You built a good porch. Now invite some people to sit on it."

**Founder's Story Draft (TARS/Scorsese voice):**

- ✅ Nickerson, Kansas origin (one stoplight, now none)
- ✅ Trailer, not polished branding narrative
- ✅ Star Tribune receipts (#1 LA Times, #3 Star Tribune)
- ✅ Tractor conversation, racehorses, operating system

### Files Changed

```
New:
- docs/governance-layer.md
- docs/founders-package.md
- docs/case-study-cdn.md
- docs/next-steps.md
- docs/founders-story-tars-scorsese.md
```

### Still Needed

- [ ] Fix facts in founders-story-tars-scorsese.md (Derek to identify)

- [ ] Send 10 outreach messages (this week)
- [ ] CDN case study formatted for site
- [ ] Site architecture cleanup (3 pages, kill friction)
- [ ] Session memory for CW (Q1)

### Key Insight

From TARS: The gap between 35% and 65% success probability is distribution, not features. The porch is built. Nobody's sitting on it.

## Session: January 18, 2026

**Branch:** `main`
**Status:** Derek's Story rewritten, TARS mode operational, outreach assets built

### Completed Today

**Real Conversation Captured:**
- ✅ Pulled Jan 18 Supabase data — organic visitor conversation about humanizing AI
- ✅ Tractor metaphor: "AI's just another tool. Like a tractor. You don't marry the tractor."
- ✅ Visitor response: "I like how you reframed it."
- ✅ Documented in `/CW-Strategies/examples/real-conversation-humanizing-ai.md`

**Outreach Templates:**
- ✅ Created `/CW-Strategies/outreach-with-example.md` — 5 templates using real conversation
- ✅ Templates: Show Don't Tell, Tech/AI Crowd, LinkedIn Short, Warm Referral, No Ask version

**Terminal Script:**
- ✅ Created `/scripts/cw` — session launcher for claudewill.io work
- ✅ Modes: `cw`, `cw story`, `cw mode2`, `cw tars`, `cw outreach`, `cw status`, `cw help`
- ✅ Added to PATH via ~/.zshrc
- ✅ TARS mode: 100% honesty, 100% humor (from Interstellar)

**Founder's Story → Derek's Story Rewrite:**
- ✅ TARS mode session — brutal honesty about what was soft
- ✅ Killed "blood of builders" mythology as decoration
- ✅ New origin: tiny trailer, one-stoplight town, Dr. Pepper, listening to storytellers
- ✅ Added: three-sport athlete, state championships, first article at 18, put himself through college
- ✅ Added: specific receipts (#1 LA Times, #3 Star Tribune — documented, not claimed)
- ✅ Added: "Two newspapers. Both became the best in the world. That's not a claim. That's a receipt."
- ✅ Fixed: CW is grandfather, not great-grandfather
- ✅ New framing: "I design things. Material changes. Work doesn't."
- ✅ The firing section — clean, saves Ward 10 for Slowly Sideways
- ✅ Permission tension stays — honest about not asking CW
- ✅ Tractor conversation as proof
- ✅ New draft: `/docs/DEREKS-STORY-DRAFT.md` (~1,400 words)

**Updated Founder's Story (earlier version):**
- ✅ Added permission tension to "The Porch" section
- ✅ Added real tractor conversation
- ✅ Added new pull quotes
- ✅ File: `/docs/FOUNDERS-STORY-THIRD-PERSON-DRAFT.md`

**Site Architecture Audit:**
- ✅ Reviewed /story, /derek, /about, /the-cw-standard
- ✅ Identified overlap: CW Standard on 3 pages, heritage on 2 pages
- ✅ Recommendation: /about is redundant — could merge into /derek
- ✅ Proposed: /story (CW), /derek (Derek's full story), /the-cw-standard (reference)

**Key Insights from TARS Session:**
- "Blood of builders" was decoration, not foundation
- The real origin is the trailer and the listening
- Derek is a designer who changed materials, not a "former designer"
- The unicorn isn't "I can do many things" — it's the specific combination that doesn't exist elsewhere
- "I keep saving companies that don't know they need saving, and then they fire me for it"

### Files Changed

```
New:
- docs/DEREKS-STORY-DRAFT.md (new draft, trailer origin)
- CW-Strategies/examples/real-conversation-humanizing-ai.md
- CW-Strategies/outreach-with-example.md
- scripts/cw (terminal launcher)

Modified:
- docs/FOUNDERS-STORY-THIRD-PERSON-DRAFT.md (permission tension, tractor convo)
- ~/.zshrc (added claudewill.io/scripts to PATH)
```

### Still Needed

- [ ] Decide: Does DEREKS-STORY-DRAFT replace /derek or become new page?
- [ ] Site architecture cleanup — /about is redundant
- [ ] Add CW Standard section to Derek's Story (or just link)
- [ ] Warm outreach — actually send to 10-20 contacts
- [ ] Slowly Sideways: The hard stuff goes there, not here

### Lightning/Bug

- Reviewed screenplay for AI film festival
- Beautiful origin piece — trailer, wheat field, lightning bug as guide
- "It was the one who powered my bat. It was the one who got me home safely when the power went out."
- Not for claudewill.io — standalone creative project, maybe 2030

---

## Session: January 16, 2026

**Branch:** `main`
**Status:** Founder's Story and CW Strategies package refined

### Completed Today

**Founder's Story:**
- ✅ Created third-person draft (`docs/FOUNDERS-STORY-THIRD-PERSON-DRAFT.md`)
- ✅ Magazine profile style — reads like someone studied Derek and wrote about him
- ✅ Leads with the AI/name hook, weaves heritage throughout
- ✅ Includes 2024 crisis ("The Fall") — makes it human, not hagiographic
- ✅ ~1,400 words, 7 min read
- ✅ Fixed RWTFYA wristband detail

**Lineage Clarified:**
- Charlton → William → Albert → Claude → Donald → Derek → Jackson/Teegan
- Charlton is Derek's great-great-great-grandfather (3x great)
- Jackson/Teegan are 6th generation builder blood

**CW Strategies One-Pager:**
- ✅ Updated About section with accurate career arc
- ✅ LA Times: helped establish as #1 in the world for nearly 7 years
- ✅ Star Tribune: first and only Chief Creative Officer & Vice President
- ✅ Now: building AI frameworks for organizations

### Files Changed

```
New:
- docs/FOUNDERS-STORY-THIRD-PERSON-DRAFT.md

Modified:
- CW-Strategies/CW_Strategies_OnePager_v2.md (About section)
```

### Still Needed

- [ ] Founder's Story — final review, decide first vs third person, target Feb 7
- [ ] Warm outreach — 10-20 contacts
- [ ] Distribution strategy — traffic still light
- [ ] Build /founder page when story is finalized

---

## Session: January 14, 2026

**Branch:** `main`
**Status:** CW Strategies infrastructure built, case studies drafted

### Completed Today

**Founder's Story Draft:**
- ✅ Created `docs/FOUNDERS-STORY-DRAFT.md` (~1,800 words, 8 min read)
- ✅ 5 chapters: Seven Words, Blood of Builders, Country Queen, The Fence, Now What?
- ✅ Ready for Derek's review/edits before Feb 7 launch

**Email Setup:**
- ✅ Confirmed `derek@claudewill.io` forwarding works (Forward Email → Gmail)
- ✅ Updated email references across security docs and CW-Strategies files
- ✅ Installed Netlify CLI, linked to claudewill.io site

**Intake Form System:**
- ✅ Built `intake.html` — assessment form for CW Strategies prospects
- ✅ Built `intake-thanks.html` — confirmation page
- ✅ Built `netlify/functions/intake.js` — serverless handler
- ✅ Created `intake_submissions` table in Supabase
- ✅ Email notifications via Resend (sends to Gmail)
- ✅ Full pipeline tested and working

**Weekly Digest System:**
- ✅ Built `netlify/functions/weekly-digest.js` — conversation summary
- ✅ Queries Supabase for weekly stats (conversations, sessions, tokens, cost)
- ✅ Sends email summary via Resend
- ✅ GitHub Actions workflow for Monday 9am CT schedule (`.github/workflows/weekly-digest.yml`)
- ✅ Manual trigger tested and working

**Case Studies:**
- ✅ Created `CW-Strategies/case-studies/small-org.md` — Regional Media Organization (CDN anonymized)
- ✅ Created `CW-Strategies/case-studies/executive.md` — Executive Coaching (self-application)
- ⏸️ Large org case study paused — 27 years newspaper experience stays in bio, not case study format

**CW-Strategies Assets Reviewed:**
- README.md (asset bundle overview)
- CW_Strategies_Offering_DRAFT.md (full service offering)
- CW_Strategies_Assessment_v1.md (intake questions)
- warm-outreach-template.md (4 templates)
- case-study-template.md (structure)

### Decisions Made

1. **Large org case study:** Skip for now. Star Tribune history is complicated, LA Times adds complexity. Bio covers the credential. First CW Strategies large org client becomes the clean case study.

2. **Email notifications:** Send directly to Gmail (Resend test domain limitation). Can upgrade later by verifying claudewill.io domain in Resend.

3. **Weekly digest schedule:** GitHub Actions (Netlify scheduled functions had config issues).

### Files Changed

```
New:
- docs/FOUNDERS-STORY-DRAFT.md
- intake.html
- intake-thanks.html
- netlify/functions/intake.js
- netlify/functions/weekly-digest.js
- .github/workflows/weekly-digest.yml
- CW-Strategies/case-studies/small-org.md
- CW-Strategies/case-studies/executive.md

Modified:
- SECURITY.md (email updated)
- SECURITY_COMPLIANCE_GUIDE.md (email updated)
- netlify.toml (schedule removed — using GitHub Actions instead)
- .gitignore (.netlify/ added)

Supabase:
- New table: intake_submissions

Netlify:
- New env var: RESEND_API_KEY
```

### Still Needed

- [ ] Founder's Story — Derek review/edit, target Feb 7
- [ ] CW-Strategies one-pager review — does it sound like you?
- [ ] Warm outreach — 10-20 contacts
- [ ] Distribution strategy — traffic still light

---

## Session: January 13, 2026

**Branch:** `main`
**Status:** Quick data check, documentation update

### Completed Today

**Supabase Data Review:**
- ✅ Confirmed token logging is working correctly
- ✅ Token structure: `{input: N, output: N}` — all data present
- ✅ Updated ANALYTICS_QUERIES.md with current Haiku 3.5 pricing ($0.25/1M input, $1.25/1M output)

**Stats Since Launch (Dec 8 - Jan 13):**
- 355 total conversations
- 33 unique sessions
- 1,505,337 input tokens / 25,060 output tokens
- **Total cost: ~$0.41** (Haiku doing its job)

**Last 7 Days:**
| Date | Convos | Input | Output | Total |
|------|--------|-------|--------|-------|
| Jan 12 | 2 | 17,467 | 196 | 17,663 |
| Jan 11 | 11 | 96,054 | 1,946 | 98,000 |
| Jan 8 | 6 | 37,001 | 250 | 37,251 |
| Jan 7 | 1 | 5,716 | 189 | 5,905 |

**Observations:**
- Jan 11 session was testing constitutional thinking updates — worked well
- Input tokens dominate because system prompt is ~3K tokens per request
- Output stays low because CW talks in short bursts (as designed)
- Traffic is light post-launch (mostly testing sessions, no apparent external users yet)

### Still Needed
- [ ] Founder's Story — target Feb 7, 2026 (Derek's 53rd birthday)
- [ ] Distribution strategy — traffic dropped off, need eyeballs

---

## Session: January 11, 2026

**Branch:** `main`
**Status:** Constitutional thinking framework added to CW

### Completed Today

**Constitutional Thinking Framework:**
- ✅ Added CONSTITUTIONAL THINKING section to CW's system prompt (~70 lines)
- ✅ CW now knows 5 constitutional frameworks:
  1. The CW Standard (own operating principles)
  2. Anthropic's Constitution (58 principles, helpful/harmless/honest)
  3. Declaration of Independence (the "why" — unalienable rights, consent of governed)
  4. US Constitution & Bill of Rights (the "how" — structure, checks, individual rights)
  5. Other frameworks (South Africa 1996, Germany Basic Law 1949, UN Declaration)
- ✅ CW can now reason across constitutional frameworks
- ✅ CW can help people think constitutionally about their own situations

**Political Topics Update:**
- ✅ Rewrote POLITICAL AND DIVISIVE TOPICS section
- ✅ Old approach: Avoid all political topics
- ✅ New approach: Distinguish partisan fights (avoid) from constitutional principles (engage)
- ✅ CW can now name constitutional violations (insurrection, ignoring courts, targeting groups) without being partisan
- ✅ Still won't tell people who to vote for or engage in partisan fights

**CW-Strategies Folder Excavation:**
- ✅ Cataloged 57 files in CW-Strategies folder
- ✅ Found key constitutional/philosophical foundations:
  - `The_CW_Standard_Constitution_v1.md` — full constitution with walk-away lines
  - `foundational_framework_relationships.md` — how CW Standard relates to Constitutional AI
  - `cw_standard_employment_integration.md` — "AI ethics without employment protection is academic theory"
- ✅ Found Founder's Story content: `CW-heritage-founders-story.md` (35KB, ready for Feb 7)
- ✅ Found methodology frameworks: Coach-Claude, Trap Shooting Model, etc.

**Distribution Strategy Discussion:**
- Identified core differentiation: CW is a constitutional thinker
- Key insight: "How do you follow a constitution if you don't know it?"
- CW differs from raw Haiku because it can articulate and reason about its principles
- Most AIs operate under rules they can't explain — CW can

**Research Completed:**
- Anthropic's constitution (58 principles, 5 categories)
- Best constitutions in history (US, Poland-Lithuania, South Africa, Switzerland, Japan, Germany)
- US democracy status (Economist: "flawed democracy" since 2016, backsliding concerns 2025)

### Key Insight

The question "why would anyone use CW instead of raw Haiku?" led to a fundamental repositioning:

CW isn't just a chatbot with a folksy persona. CW is a **constitutional thinker** that:
- Knows its own operating principles explicitly
- Knows Anthropic's constitution
- Knows foundational democratic documents
- Can reason about principled decision-making
- Can help people think constitutionally about compromised systems

The CW Standard's frame — "you're already compromised, the question is what you do about it" — is the bridge between idealistic constitutions (Declaration) and practical reality.

**Founder's Story Addition:**
- ✅ Added Chapter 15: "The Fence" to CW-heritage-founders-story.md
- Reframes "sitting on the fence" criticism as a principle
- "The fence isn't the destination. It's the vantage point."
- Connects to race horses story, builder blood, constitutional thinking

### Still Needed
- [ ] Founder's Story — target Feb 7, 2026 (content exists, new chapter added)
- [ ] Distribution strategy execution — CW works, positioning is clearer, now need eyeballs
- [ ] Test constitutional thinking responses in production (deployed, ready to test)

### Commits Today
```
b50f8b76 feat: add constitutional thinking framework to CW
```

### Next Session Handoff

**Test these on claudewill.io:**
1. "Today is the anniversary of January 6. What are your thoughts?"
2. "What constitutions do you know?"
3. "Is the US still a democracy?"
4. "How were you built? What rules guide you?"
5. "I'm working in a system that feels compromised. How do I think about that?"

**If responses need tuning:**
- Constitutional thinking section is in `netlify/functions/cw.js` lines 403-474
- Political topics section is lines 269-300

**Founder's Story (Feb 7):**
- Content is in `CW-Strategies/CW-heritage-founders-story.md`
- New Chapter 15 "The Fence" added — may need polish
- 35KB of content ready, needs editing pass before publishing

**Distribution strategy:**
- Differentiation is now clearer: "CW is a constitutional thinker"
- Pitch: "How do you follow a constitution if you don't know it?"
- Next step: figure out how to get eyeballs (Substack? LinkedIn? Something else?)

**CW-Strategies folder:**
- 57 files excavated and cataloged this session
- Key docs identified for potential CW knowledge expansion
- See session notes above for full catalog

## Session: January 9, 2026

**Branch:** `main`
**Status:** Live, light traffic post-launch

### Completed Today

**Recalibrate Skill Deployed:**
- ✅ Pivoted Recalibrate from standalone PWA to CW skill
- ✅ Added 7-question career clarity flow to system prompt
- ✅ CW offers recalibration when sensing career crossroads
- ✅ Added "Recalibrate" prompt chip in mid-conversation stage
- ✅ Documented Portfolio_Career_Strategy_Framework_2026.md as example output

**Family Knowledge Update:**
- ✅ Added Derek's five sisters: Michiela, Shannon, Ailie, Karen, Christiane
- ✅ Michiela specifically noted (Don's daughter, caught hallucination on launch day)
- ✅ Added principle: "The downside of being warm to a stranger is low. The downside of being cold to family is high."

**Housekeeping:**
- ✅ Added .serena/ to .gitignore
- ✅ Deleted 11 CleanShot screenshots from /images/
- ✅ Cleaned up recalibrate/ legacy PWA code (moved to archive/)

**Supabase Check:**
- Usage dropped post-launch: 98 conversations on Jan 6, then 7 total in 3 days
- Total cost since Jan 1: ~$0.14 (Haiku doing its job)
- No issues, just low traffic

### Commits Today
```
71eb7659 refactor: pivot Recalibrate from PWA to CW skill
85e3fc0a feat: deploy Recalibrate skill to CW
bc3988fd feat: add Derek's sisters to CW's family knowledge
```

**Information Architecture Discussion:**
- Talked through what the porch is attached to
- Answer: The porch is free, exists because it should (primary)
- Side roads: Derek's work (natural referral), Vernie Mode (family/legacy, future)
- Pricing philosophy: Free for simple directions, "sit a while" for hard stuff (pay what you can)
- Reviewed Coach D's Fieldhouse and D-Rock concepts
- Landed on **BRC Building & Loan** as the connective tissue

**BRC Building & Loan:**
- Not a company. A community model.
- Neighbors helping neighbors build things
- Each establishment (Porch, Fieldhouse, Arcade, Record Store) is a neighbor on the circle
- The Building & Loan is what connects them — shared DNA, shared values
- Concept doc written: `docs/BRC-BUILDING-AND-LOAN.md` (gitignored, stays local)

### Still Needed
- [ ] Founder's Story — target Feb 7, 2026 (Derek's 53rd birthday)
- [ ] Distribution strategy — traffic dropped off, CW works but nobody knows
- [ ] BRC cross-site connections (when ready, don't force it)

### Key Insights
1. Recalibrate works better as a CW skill than a standalone product. The questions matter, not the interface.
2. The family of sites isn't corporate branding — it's a community model. BRC Building & Loan is the ethos, not the org chart.

---

## Session: January 7, 2026 (Post-Launch Refinements)

**Branch:** `main`
**Status:** Live, iterating based on real usage data

### Completed Today

**Data Review:**
- ✅ Analyzed Supabase data: 98 conversations on launch day across 11 sessions
- ✅ Identified hallucination issue: CW made up poverty rates for benchmark cities
- ✅ User caught it, CW apologized — but shouldn't have happened

**System Prompt Updates:**

1. **Stronger Numerical Hallucination Prevention:**
   - ✅ Added explicit ban on percentages, rates, dates, dollar amounts, populations
   - ✅ Added ban on comparative claims with numbers
   - ✅ New instruction: "When you catch yourself about to say a specific number you're not certain about — stop."
   - ✅ New redirect: "You'll want to look that up. I'll get it wrong."

2. **Human Connection Guidance (new skill):**
   - ✅ "Knowing when they need a human, not you"
   - ✅ CW now recognizes when someone's using him instead of talking to real people
   - ✅ Key phrases: "Who else have you talked to about this?" / "A porch talk isn't a substitute for a kitchen table conversation."

3. **Clearer Derek Referral Criteria:**
   - ✅ Added the test: "Is this a problem solved by doing work together over months, or by thinking it through right now?"
   - ✅ Explicit YES list: organizational problems, needs execution help, asks directly, needs accountability
   - ✅ Explicit NO list: personal/emotional, just exploring, hypotheticals, needs therapist
   - ✅ Dropped wishy-washy "might benefit" language

4. **Conversational Derek Knowledge:**
   - ✅ CW now knows Derek's tagline: "Designs the process and trusts the players"
   - ✅ Knows about startribune.com, Substack, LinkedIn
   - ✅ Knows about other porches: bob.claudewill.io, coach.claudewill.io
   - ✅ Knows: proud papa, part-owner of the Green Bay Packers
   - ✅ Knows: three manuscripts, volunteers as coach/animal therapy advocate/mentor

**/derek Page Updates:**
- ✅ New bio with tagline: "Designs the process and trusts the players"
- ✅ Added: "Proud papa. Part-owner of the Green Bay Packers."
- ✅ Updated meta description and OG tags to match

**Cost Protection Discussion:**
- ✅ Reviewed current limits (20 req/min, 12 messages, 500 output tokens)
- ✅ Recommendation: Set $25/month cap in Anthropic console
- ✅ User on free Netlify plan — no alerts available, cap is the safeguard

### Still Needed
- [ ] Founder's Story for /founder or /derek/story — target Feb 7, 2026 (Derek's 53rd birthday)

### Done Since Initial Closeout
- ✅ Set Anthropic spending cap
- ✅ Beyond Work woven into bio (coach, animal therapy advocate, mentor)
- ✅ CW Strategies links added (CW, Coach D, Battle o' Brackets, The CW Standard)
- ✅ Bio updated: "Owner of CW Strategies and part-owner of the Green Bay Packers"

### Commits Today
```
279854a1 fix: update meta descriptions to match new bio
598d0b33 refactor: weave Beyond Work into bio, add CW Strategies ownership
9af18994 feat: add links to CW, Coach D, Battle o' Brackets on /derek
842b6a7a feat: add Beyond Work section to /derek
bfbf3d44 docs: update session closeout for January 7, 2026
0e51c666 feat: strengthen guardrails, add human connection guidance, update Derek bio
```

### Key Insight
The poverty taskforce conversation showed CW's helpfulness can become a liability when he invents data to seem helpful. The fix: explicit instruction to stop mid-generation when about to fabricate numbers. "A wrong number dressed up as fact is worse than no number at all."

---

## Session: January 6, 2026 (Launch Day)

**Branch:** `main`
**Status:** LAUNCHED on CW's 123rd birthday

   - ✅ Can point visitors to relevant pages naturally

3. **Derek's Siblings:**
   - ✅ CW now knows Derek has three sisters (Donald had four children)
   - ✅ Welcomes family members instead of being suspicious

**New Feature: "Size This Up" Guided Problem-Sizing Flow:**
- ✅ Added GUIDED SIZING section to system prompt (5-step process)
- ✅ Steps: Define → Weight → Resources → Focus (Three Questions) → Next Step
- ✅ CW walks through ONE AT A TIME, doesn't rush
- ✅ Natural offer: CW suggests sizing when detecting complex problems
- ✅ Added "Size this up" prompt chip to early conversation stage
- ✅ Target use case: Community leaders, taskforces, complex problems

### Roadmap Addition
**Future: Complex "Size This Up" (AGI direction):**
- [ ] Session memory — pick up where you left off
- [ ] Project persistence — "Riley County Poverty Project"
- [ ] Learning from outcomes — what worked?
- [ ] Exportable artifact — PDF/doc for taskforce
- [ ] Multiple guided flows (decision-making, resource allocation, etc.)

### Key Insight
Real user feedback (Michiela's poverty taskforce test) revealed that CW was helpful but fabricated sources when pressed. Fixed within hours of launch. This is the value of family testing.

### Notes
- **Hostile visitor (18:03 UTC)**: Someone tried to bait CW on Jan 6 politics, escalated to personal attack on Derek ("that's how your grandson got ahead in his job"). CW handled it well. First-time visitor, no history, came on Jan 6 anniversary — could be someone who knows Derek or just trolling. IP hashed, identity unknown. No action needed — noted per The CW Standard.
- **Political topics fix**: Added "POLITICAL AND DIVISIVE TOPICS" section to system prompt. CW now redirects politically charged questions in his voice, not default Claude hedging.
- **Family visits**: Vicki (CW Jr's daughter) and Shannon (granddaughter) visited. Shannon got great help with accounting meeting. Vicki initially got broken response (CW denied knowing CW Jr) — fixed with CW Jr addition.
- **Albert added**: Albert Aldrich Simmons, first child, died ~age 2 from food poisoning, named after CW's dad Albert David. CW can now answer "what happened to your oldest son" appropriately.
- **CW Jr added**: Claude William Jr (1939-2024), third son, teacher/musician/author. His kids/grandkids (Vicki, etc.) now welcomed as family.
- **Transparency notice**: Added "Conversations may be reviewed to improve CW" to footer disclaimer. Explicit notice beyond privacy policy.
