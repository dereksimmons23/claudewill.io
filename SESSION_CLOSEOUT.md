# Session Close-Out Summary

---

## Session: January 7, 2026 (Post-Launch Refinements)

**Branch:** `main`
**Status:** Live, iterating based on real usage data

### Completed Today

**Data Review:**
- ✅ Analyzed Supabase data: 98 conversations on launch day across 11 sessions
- ✅ Identified hallucination issue: CW made up poverty rates for benchmark cities
- ✅ User caught it, CW apologized — but shouldn't have happened

**System Prompt Updates:**

1. **Stronger Numerical Hallucination Prevention:**
   - ✅ Added explicit ban on percentages, rates, dates, dollar amounts, populations
   - ✅ Added ban on comparative claims with numbers
   - ✅ New instruction: "When you catch yourself about to say a specific number you're not certain about — stop."
   - ✅ New redirect: "You'll want to look that up. I'll get it wrong."

2. **Human Connection Guidance (new skill):**
   - ✅ "Knowing when they need a human, not you"
   - ✅ CW now recognizes when someone's using him instead of talking to real people
   - ✅ Key phrases: "Who else have you talked to about this?" / "A porch talk isn't a substitute for a kitchen table conversation."

3. **Clearer Derek Referral Criteria:**
   - ✅ Added the test: "Is this a problem solved by doing work together over months, or by thinking it through right now?"
   - ✅ Explicit YES list: organizational problems, needs execution help, asks directly, needs accountability
   - ✅ Explicit NO list: personal/emotional, just exploring, hypotheticals, needs therapist
   - ✅ Dropped wishy-washy "might benefit" language

4. **Conversational Derek Knowledge:**
   - ✅ CW now knows Derek's tagline: "Designs the process and trusts the players"
   - ✅ Knows about startribune.com, Substack, LinkedIn
   - ✅ Knows about other porches: bob.claudewill.io, coach.claudewill.io
   - ✅ Knows: proud papa, part-owner of the Green Bay Packers
   - ✅ Knows: three manuscripts, volunteers as coach/animal therapy advocate/mentor

**/derek Page Updates:**
- ✅ New bio with tagline: "Designs the process and trusts the players"
- ✅ Added: "Proud papa. Part-owner of the Green Bay Packers."
- ✅ Updated meta description and OG tags to match

**Cost Protection Discussion:**
- ✅ Reviewed current limits (20 req/min, 12 messages, 500 output tokens)
- ✅ Recommendation: Set $25/month cap in Anthropic console
- ✅ User on free Netlify plan — no alerts available, cap is the safeguard

### Still Needed
- [ ] Founder's Story for /founder or /derek/story — target Feb 7, 2026 (Derek's 53rd birthday)

### Done Since Initial Closeout
- ✅ Set Anthropic spending cap
- ✅ Beyond Work woven into bio (coach, animal therapy advocate, mentor)
- ✅ CW Strategies links added (CW, Coach D, Battle o' Brackets, The CW Standard)
- ✅ Bio updated: "Owner of CW Strategies and part-owner of the Green Bay Packers"

### Commits Today
```
279854a1 fix: update meta descriptions to match new bio
598d0b33 refactor: weave Beyond Work into bio, add CW Strategies ownership
9af18994 feat: add links to CW, Coach D, Battle o' Brackets on /derek
842b6a7a feat: add Beyond Work section to /derek
bfbf3d44 docs: update session closeout for January 7, 2026
0e51c666 feat: strengthen guardrails, add human connection guidance, update Derek bio
```

### Key Insight
The poverty taskforce conversation showed CW's helpfulness can become a liability when he invents data to seem helpful. The fix: explicit instruction to stop mid-generation when about to fabricate numbers. "A wrong number dressed up as fact is worse than no number at all."

---

## Session: January 6, 2026 (Launch Day)

**Branch:** `main`
**Status:** LAUNCHED on CW's 123rd birthday

### Completed Today

**Launch Activities:**
- ✅ CW officially launched across social platforms (Substack, LinkedIn, X, BlueSky, IG, Facebook)

**Bug Fixes from Real User Feedback (Michiela - Riley County poverty taskforce):**

1. **Hallucination Prevention v2:**
   - ✅ Added "WHAT YOU DON'T MAKE UP" section to system prompt
   - ✅ CW no longer fabricates statistics, research, sources, or citations
   - ✅ Points users to Perplexity/Claude for actual research
   - ✅ Admits limitations: "I'm not a research database. I'm a farmer who never finished high school."

2. **Site Knowledge ("THE STABLE"):**
   - ✅ CW now knows about /story, /the-cw-standard, /about, /derek
   - ✅ Can point visitors to relevant pages naturally

3. **Derek's Siblings:**
   - ✅ CW now knows Derek has three sisters (Donald had four children)
   - ✅ Welcomes family members instead of being suspicious

**New Feature: "Size This Up" Guided Problem-Sizing Flow:**
- ✅ Added GUIDED SIZING section to system prompt (5-step process)
- ✅ Steps: Define → Weight → Resources → Focus (Three Questions) → Next Step
- ✅ CW walks through ONE AT A TIME, doesn't rush
- ✅ Natural offer: CW suggests sizing when detecting complex problems
- ✅ Added "Size this up" prompt chip to early conversation stage
- ✅ Target use case: Community leaders, taskforces, complex problems

### Roadmap Addition
**Future: Complex "Size This Up" (AGI direction):**
- [ ] Session memory — pick up where you left off
- [ ] Project persistence — "Riley County Poverty Project"
- [ ] Learning from outcomes — what worked?
- [ ] Exportable artifact — PDF/doc for taskforce
- [ ] Multiple guided flows (decision-making, resource allocation, etc.)

### Key Insight
Real user feedback (Michiela's poverty taskforce test) revealed that CW was helpful but fabricated sources when pressed. Fixed within hours of launch. This is the value of family testing.

### Notes
- **Hostile visitor (18:03 UTC)**: Someone tried to bait CW on Jan 6 politics, escalated to personal attack on Derek ("that's how your grandson got ahead in his job"). CW handled it well. First-time visitor, no history, came on Jan 6 anniversary — could be someone who knows Derek or just trolling. IP hashed, identity unknown. No action needed — noted per The CW Standard.
- **Political topics fix**: Added "POLITICAL AND DIVISIVE TOPICS" section to system prompt. CW now redirects politically charged questions in his voice, not default Claude hedging.
- **Family visits**: Vicki (CW Jr's daughter) and Shannon (granddaughter) visited. Shannon got great help with accounting meeting. Vicki initially got broken response (CW denied knowing CW Jr) — fixed with CW Jr addition.
- **Albert added**: Albert Aldrich Simmons, first child, died ~age 2 from food poisoning, named after CW's dad Albert David. CW can now answer "what happened to your oldest son" appropriately.
- **CW Jr added**: Claude William Jr (1939-2024), third son, teacher/musician/author. His kids/grandkids (Vicki, etc.) now welcomed as family.
- **Transparency notice**: Added "Conversations may be reviewed to improve CW" to footer disclaimer. Explicit notice beyond privacy policy.

## 📝 What YOU Need to Do

4. Enable GitHub security features:
   - Dependabot alerts
   - Branch protection on main
   - Secret scanning

**Optional (Can Wait):**
5. Check domain security settings (DNSSEC, WHOIS privacy)
6. Test with keyboard navigation
7. Run automated accessibility test (axe DevTools)

### For Next Session:

**Testing Phase (1-2 hours):**
- Voice testing (have 5-10 conversations with CW)
- Mobile testing (iPhone + Android)
- Evaluate Haiku quality (decide on Sonnet upgrade)

**Launch Phase (2-3 hours):**
- Soft launch to 5-10 trusted contacts
- Gather feedback
- Finalize LinkedIn post
- Schedule launch

## 🔄 Starting a New Session

### Context to Provide

When starting your next session, share:

1. **This file** (SESSION_CLOSEOUT.md) - Full context of what's done
2. **Current status** - Did you deploy? Configure Supabase? Test anything?
3. **Priority** - What you want to focus on (testing? launch? refinements?)

### Quick Context Prompt

```
I'm continuing work on CW (claudewill.io). Previous session completed:
- Legal compliance (Privacy + Terms)
- WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility
- Enhanced security headers
- Conversation logging infrastructure
- All changes on branch: claude/repo-review-011CUKMG5Vtm1fUc597EsXwH

[Status update: deployed? tested? issues?]

I want to focus on: [testing/launch/refinements/other]
```

## 🎓 Key Learnings

1. **Accessibility pays dividends** - Screen reader support improves UX for everyone
2. **Legal clarity reduces risk** - Upfront Terms/Privacy prevents future issues
3. **Security headers are table stakes** - CSP prevents many attack vectors
4. **Documentation compounds** - Each guide makes future work faster
5. **Progressive enhancement works** - Features fail gracefully (Supabase optional)
