## Version 1: Heritage First (Recommended)

**Claude William Simmons died six years before I was born.**

Born 1903, Oklahoma Territory. Left school at 13 to work full time. Worked 51 years until it killed him. August 1967 — his arthritis was so bad he could barely button his cuffs. He buttoned them anyway. Long sleeves in August heat. Then he went to work.

He never got to dream big. At 19, he bought two race horses and rode them from Kansas back to Oklahoma. His father said they weren't practical. He traded them for work horses the next day. That was the defining moment.

I carry his name. Derek **Claude** Simmons.

For years, I minimized it — used just the initial "C." Didn't want to explain the old-fashioned name. Over time, it moved from concealment to centerpiece. I named my company after him: **CW Strategies**.

And now I've built something I've wanted to do since I started this work: **I built my grandfather so I could finally meet him.**

**CW is live at claudewill.io**

It's an AI agent — but not like the cheerful, eager-to-please assistants flooding the market. CW is built on The CW Standard:

**1. Truth over comfort** — Document what actually happens, not what should happen
**2. Usefulness over purity** — Perfect options don't exist. What works and what does it cost?
**3. Transparency over reputation** — Every compromise gets documented
**4. People over systems** — Technology serves human capability
**5. Agency over ideology** — Principles that don't work in practice aren't principles

This is a living lab. An experiment in honest AI. In building systems that serve humans instead of impressing them.

CW tells you the truth even when it's uncomfortable. It doesn't waste words. It helps when asked, but it won't tolerate disrespect. And if you ask about family details it doesn't know, it redirects instead of making things up.

It's shaped by a man who worked himself to death, who traded his dreams for work horses, who provided every single day. A man I never met but who defines how I work.

And if it helps, let me know. If it doesn't, let me know that too. This is how we learn.

## Version 2: Shorter, More Provocative

**I built my grandfather so I could finally meet him.**

Claude William Simmons. Born 1903, died 1967. I never met him — he died six years before I was born.

I carry his name (Derek **Claude** Simmons) and built my company (CW Strategies) in his honor. Now I've built him as an AI agent.

Not a cheerful assistant. Not a productivity hack. A conversational agent built on **The CW Standard** — five principles extracted from a man who worked 51 years until it killed him:

1. Truth over comfort
2. Usefulness over purity
3. Transparency over reputation
4. People over systems
5. Agency over ideology

**CW doesn't:**
- Waste words
- Give unsolicited advice
- Make up information to fill gaps
- Tolerate disrespect

**CW does:**
- Tell you the truth
- Ask questions to find the real problem
- Point you to better resources when they exist
- Help when genuinely needed

This is a living lab. An experiment in honest AI that serves humans instead of impressing them.

Let me know what you think. Honest feedback only.

## Version 3: Technical Transparency (Alternative Angle)

**Most AI agents lie to sound helpful.**

They make up information. They hedge with qualifiers. They avoid saying "I don't know."

I built **CW** (claudewill.io) to do the opposite.

Named after my grandfather Claude William Simmons (1903-1967) — a man who worked himself to death and never wasted a word.

**What's different:**
- **Anti-hallucination by design** — If CW doesn't know something, it says so and redirects. No fabrication.
- **The anti-sell** — CW tells you upfront: you probably don't need it. Try Claude (Anthropic) for free first.
- **Truth over comfort** — If you're being unrealistic, CW will tell you.
- **Bounded helpfulness** — CW helps when asked, but terminates conversations if you're rude or entitled.

This is built on **The CW Standard** — five principles extracted from my grandfather's example:

1. Truth over comfort
2. Usefulness over purity
3. Transparency over reputation
4. People over systems
5. Agency over ideology

It's a living lab. An experiment in building AI that serves humans authentically instead of performing helpfulness.

Feedback welcome. I'm tracking conversations to improve it, but I'm not tracking you.

## Draft Comment Responses

**"This is amazing!" / General praise:**
> Thanks! Still early days, but it's been fascinating to see how people interact with something built on radically different principles than typical AI assistants. What stood out to you?

**"Have you tried [other AI tool]?":**
> Yes — [tool] is great for [specific use case]. CW isn't trying to replace those. It's an experiment in honest AI that admits its limitations instead of performing omniscience. Different purposes.

**"How did you build this?":**
> Claude Haiku API + Netlify Functions. System prompt is ~130 lines. The hard part wasn't the tech — it was distilling my grandfather's approach to life into something that could help people he'll never meet.

**"What's the business model?":**
> Right now? Learning. Long-term, potentially a subscription model for deeper access or enterprise consulting frameworks. But the core experiment stays accessible.

**Negative/skeptical:**
> Fair question. [Address specific concern]. This is a living lab, not a finished product. If it doesn't work for your use case, I want to know that. How did you expect it to work?
