# Recalibrate: Mobile-First Career Intelligence Platform

## Project Title
**Recalibrate: Where Professionals Fine-Tune Their Future**

## Project Description
Recalibrate is the world's first mobile-first career intelligence platform that combines human intuition with AI precision to help professionals navigate algorithmic hiring systems while honoring their authentic career aspirations. Built by Derek Simmons, a GLG expert who advises Fortune 500 executives on AI strategy, Recalibrate addresses the fundamental disconnect between how professionals actually make career decisions and how current platforms assume they should.

**Mission**: Transform career development from desktop drudgery to mobile-native empowerment through voice-enabled, emotion-aware, and offline-first professional tools.

**Vision**: Every professional deserves career tools that recognize their full human potential, not just their keyword matching score.

## Core Value Proposition
- **Mobile-First**: The only career platform designed for thumb-driven professional development
- **Human-Centered**: Values intuition, emotion, and cultural fit alongside technical qualifications
- **ATS-Aware**: Built-in intelligence to navigate algorithmic hiring systems based on live research
- **Voice-Enabled**: Professional content creation through natural speech, not painful mobile typing
- **Expert-Validated**: Created by a GLG expert who understands both sides of the hiring equation
