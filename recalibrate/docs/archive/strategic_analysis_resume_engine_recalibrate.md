# Strategic Analysis: Resume Engine to Recalibrate Evolution

## Executive Summary

Based on comprehensive analysis of our conversation threads, project knowledge base, and real-world validation through GLG acceptance and Thomson Reuters rejection, **the strategic recommendation is to pivot from Resume Engine to Recalibrate** while leveraging existing technical assets and research insights.

**Key Finding**: The Resume Engine is functionally sound but strategically insufficient for market differentiation. Recalibrate's mobile-first approach addresses a $102 billion market opportunity with zero optimized competitors.
