## Research Objective

Document systematic analysis of Applicant Tracking System (ATS) algorithmic bias against cross-domain professionals to inform Recalibrate platform development and user optimization strategies.

## Methodology

### Live Case Study Approach
- **Real Applications**: Submit actual job applications with documented outcomes
- **Controlled Variables**: Same candidate, different presentation strategies
- **Timeline Tracking**: Document response times and rejection patterns
- **ATS Platform Analysis**: Identify specific platform behaviors (Workday, Greenhouse, etc.)

### Data Collection Framework
1. **Application Submission**: Track submission timestamps and methods
2. **Response Analysis**: Document response times, language patterns, rejection types
3. **Human Bypass**: Test network-based application strategies
4. **Success Correlation**: Identify factors leading to interview invitations

## Case Studies

### Case Study 1: Star Tribune Media (Completed)
- **ATS Platform**: Workday
- **Outcome**: Algorithmic rejection followed by human override success
- **Insight**: Hiring manager couldn't access qualified candidate through own system
- **Resolution**: Direct email bypass required for successful interview/offer

### Case Study 2: Thomson Reuters AI PM (Completed)
- **ATS Platform**: Unknown (likely Workday or similar)
- **Outcome**: Rapid rejection despite AI expertise for AI product role
- **Timeline**: 2-3 days ("careful consideration" language indicates algorithmic screening)
- **Insight**: Cross-domain AI expertise not recognized in legal industry context

### Case Study 3: GLG Expert Network (Completed)
- **Application Method**: Human-reviewed expert application
- **Outcome**: Successful acceptance at $500-650/hour rate
- **Insight**: Same expertise valued at Fortune 500 level when humans evaluate

## Key Findings

### Algorithmic Bias Patterns
1. **Cross-Domain Penalty**: Systems favor industry-specific experience over transferable expertise
2. **Keyword Rigidity**: Exact terminology matching prioritized over conceptual alignment
3. **Timeline Indicators**: Rapid rejections (24-72 hours) suggest minimal human review
4. **Industry Silos**: Legal, tech, healthcare systems show different bias patterns

### Success Factors
1. **Human Connection**: Network referrals bypass algorithmic screening
2. **Direct Contact**: Email to hiring managers circumvents ATS barriers
3. **Format Optimization**: PDF with proper text layer improves parsing
4. **Strategic Positioning**: Frame experience in industry-specific language

## Platform-Specific Insights

### Workday ATS
- **Behavior**: Aggressive algorithmic screening
- **Bias**: Strong industry experience weighting
- **Parsing**: Poor cross-domain experience recognition
- **Timeline**: 24-48 hour rapid rejections common

### Greenhouse
- **Behavior**: More human-friendly interface
- **Parsing**: Better document format handling
- **Customization**: Company-specific configuration variability
- **Success Rate**: Higher for network applications

## Research Applications for Recalibrate

### ATS Intelligence Engine Features
1. **Platform Detection**: Identify specific ATS from job posting URLs
2. **Optimization Recommendations**: Platform-specific resume formatting
3. **Keyword Analysis**: Industry-specific terminology weighting
4. **Success Probability**: Historical data-based outcome prediction

### User Education Components
1. **ATS Awareness**: How algorithmic screening actually works
2. **Bypass Strategies**: Network-based application approaches
3. **Format Optimization**: Technical resume preparation standards
4. **Bias Recognition**: Understanding systemic barriers and workarounds

## Ongoing Research Questions

1. **Industry Variations**: How do different sectors configure ATS bias?
2. **Seasonal Patterns**: Do rejection rates vary by hiring season/budget cycles?
3. **Company Size Impact**: SMB vs enterprise ATS configuration differences?
4. **Update Frequencies**: How often do companies update algorithmic criteria?

## Ethical Considerations

### Research Ethics
- **Transparency**: Candidates know research purpose and methods
- **Privacy**: Personal data protection and anonymization
- **Harm Mitigation**: Research serves broader professional equity goals
- **Knowledge Sharing**: Findings benefit entire professional community

### Platform Ethics
- **User Empowerment**: Information helps users navigate unfair systems
- **System Improvement**: Feedback to ATS vendors on bias issues
- **Industry Change**: Research drives awareness of algorithmic hiring problems
- **Competitive Advantage**: Evidence-based optimization vs unsubstantiated claims

## Success Metrics

### Research Quality
- **Case Study Depth**: Minimum 5 documented applications per platform
- **Timeline Accuracy**: Precise response time and method documentation
- **Outcome Correlation**: Clear cause-effect relationship identification
- **Replicability**: Methodology enables user success replication

### Platform Impact
- **User Success Rate**: Improved interview invitation rates for Recalibrate users
- **ATS Score Accuracy**: Platform predictions match actual outcomes
- **Optimization Effectiveness**: A/B testing of recommendation implementations
- **Industry Recognition**: Research cited by HR technology vendors and media

## Next Steps

### Immediate Research Priorities
1. **Harvey AI Application**: Test AI-first company ATS behavior
2. **Platform Documentation**: Create ATS-specific optimization guides
3. **User Beta Testing**: Validate research findings with Recalibrate users
4. **Industry Outreach**: Share findings with HR technology community

### Long-term Research Goals
1. **Industry Standards**: Influence ATS vendor bias mitigation practices
2. **Academic Partnership**: Collaborate with business schools on hiring bias research
3. **Policy Advocacy**: Support legislation for algorithmic hiring transparency
4. **Global Analysis**: Expand research to international hiring systems
