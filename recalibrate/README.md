## üéØ Project Overview

Recalibrate is the world's first cross-device career intelligence platform that combines human intuition with AI precision to help professionals navigate algorithmic hiring systems while honoring their authentic career aspirations.

**Revolutionary Approach**: Start your resume on mobile during your commute, finish with desktop power tools at the office, make quick edits on mobile before interviews - all seamlessly synchronized and context-aware.

**Built by Derek Simmons**, a GLG expert who advises Fortune 500 executives on AI strategy, Recalibrate addresses the fundamental disconnect between how professionals actually make career decisions and how current platforms assume they should.
