Dear Deloitte Hiring Team,

The AI Innovation, Delivery and Business Development Leader role represents the perfect intersection of my AI strategy expertise and proven revenue generation track record. Having led enterprise-wide AI implementation strategy and generated $20M+ in new revenue streams, I am excited to bring this unique combination of technical leadership and business development success to Deloitte's healthcare practice. Your focus on transforming patient care delivery while reducing administrative costs aligns directly with my experience driving operational efficiency through innovative technology solutions.

In my recent role as Executive Director at Star Tribune Media, I presented a comprehensive AI strategic plan that led to enterprise-wide Task Force development, impacting over 1,000 employees. This experience mirrors the scope of transformation your healthcare clients require. Additionally, I pioneered a franchise concept that created $15M+ in revenue growth through strategic partnershipsâ€”exactly the kind of business development thinking needed to penetrate target technology areas and build relationships with healthcare systems, payers, and providers. My ability to translate complex technical concepts for both technical and non-technical audiences has been essential in leading cross-functional teams and driving adoption of innovative solutions.

Your requirement for someone who can act as both AI thought leader and business development catalyst resonates strongly with my career trajectory. I have successfully built high-performing teams of 55+ professionals while maintaining strategic oversight of product development and implementation. My upcoming participation in MIT's AI & Data Science Program further demonstrates my commitment to staying at the forefront of AI innovation. I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my combination of AI strategy expertise, revenue generation success, and team leadership experience can contribute to Deloitte's healthcare transformation initiatives.

Sincerely,
Derek Simmons
