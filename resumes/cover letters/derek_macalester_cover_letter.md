**Macalester College Athletic Department**  
**Head Women's Basketball Coach Position**

Dear Hiring Committee,

I am writing to express my strong interest in the Head Women's Basketball Coach position at Macalester College. As someone who has dedicated 45+ years to basketball and 15+ years to head coaching, I am excited by the opportunity to build a championship-caliber program that embodies Macalester's commitment to academic excellence, competitive success, and holistic student-athlete development.

**Building Programs People Want to Join**

Throughout my coaching career, I have specialized in transforming programs by creating environments where student-athletes thrive both on the court and in the classroom. At East Ridge High School, I led our freshman team to a 17-2 record while maintaining 100% academic eligibility. In AAU basketball, I have guided multiple players to collegiate opportunities, including a current scholarship athlete at the University of Jamestown. My approach centers on developing player-led teams that communicate effectively, compete with intensity, and support each other's growth.

What excites me most about Macalester is the opportunity to work with student-athletes who are balancing rigorous academic demands with competitive athletics. Having managed executive-level responsibilities while coaching, I understand the unique challenges these students face and the support systems needed for success. My experience includes comprehensive budget management ($2M+ annual budgets), strategic planning, staff development, and the kind of organizational thinking that builds sustainable programs.

**Recruiting and Community Engagement**

My extensive network throughout Minnesota basketball—including relationships with Minnesota Heat, D1 Minnesota, Grassroots Sizzle, and high school programs across the metro—positions me to identify and recruit academically and athletically qualified student-athletes who align with Macalester's values. I believe in transparent, relationship-based recruiting that emphasizes long-term fit rather than short-term gains.

**Vision for Macalester Women's Basketball**

I see tremendous potential to elevate Macalester women's basketball while maintaining the program's academic integrity and community connection. My vision includes:

- **Player-Centered Development**: Creating individualized growth plans that enhance both athletic performance and life skills
- **Academic Excellence**: Implementing support systems that ensure student-athletes excel in their studies while competing at the highest level
- **Community Engagement**: Building strong connections between the program and the broader Macalester and Twin Cities communities
- **Competitive Success**: Developing game strategies and practice methodologies that maximize our student-athletes' potential within the MIAC

**Why Now, Why Macalester**

After a successful executive career, I am drawn to return to my coaching roots because I believe this is where I can make the greatest impact. Basketball has taught me everything I know about leadership, teamwork, and development—and I want to dedicate this next phase of my career to sharing those lessons with the next generation of student-athletes.

Macalester's commitment to combining academic rigor with competitive athletics aligns perfectly with my coaching philosophy. I am energized by the opportunity to work with student-athletes who are preparing for success far beyond basketball while still competing with the passion and intensity that makes college athletics special.

I would welcome the opportunity to discuss my vision for Macalester women's basketball and how my experience can contribute to building something exceptional in Saint Paul. Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,  
Derek Simmons
