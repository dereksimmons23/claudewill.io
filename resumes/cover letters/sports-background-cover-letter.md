Dear Mr. Willour and the Willour District Team,

I am excited to submit my application for the Financial Advisor position at Willour District – Northwestern Mutual. As a lifelong athlete, coach, and executive leader, I have seen firsthand how the traits developed through sports—teamwork, resilience, discipline, and a relentless drive to achieve—translate into professional excellence and meaningful community impact.

Throughout my 20+ years as a media executive and sports leader, I have built and led high-performing teams, transformed organizations, and mentored individuals to reach their fullest potential. Whether guiding a high school basketball team to postseason success or spearheading digital transformation at the Star Tribune Media Company, my approach has always centered on collaboration, strategic vision, and a steadfast commitment to helping others succeed. As a coach, I have developed young athletes and future leaders, many of whom have gone on to earn collegiate scholarships. As an executive, I have managed multimillion-dollar budgets, launched innovative products, and cultivated lasting partnerships across diverse industries.

I am particularly drawn to Willour District’s culture of mentorship, continuous learning, and community involvement. The stories of your team members—many of whom, like myself, come from athletic, teaching, or service backgrounds—underscore the power of diverse experiences and shared purpose. I am eager to bring my background in sports, leadership, and relationship-building to help clients achieve financial security and pursue their goals with confidence.

I am confident that my ability to build trust, communicate complex ideas clearly, and develop tailored strategies will enable me to thrive as a Financial Advisor. I am excited by the opportunity to learn from your experienced mentors, contribute to your winning team, and make a meaningful difference in the lives of individuals and families throughout our community.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss how my background and values align with the mission of Willour District – Northwestern Mutual.
