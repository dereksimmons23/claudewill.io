**Dear Better Collective Hiring Team,**

The Director, Sports Media - North America role represents the perfect convergence of my sports betting platform expertise and proven content monetization success. Having built Star Tribune's sports betting integration from concept to launch and generated $20M+ in new revenue streams through innovative content partnerships, I am excited to bring this unique combination of sports media strategy and commercial development to Better Collective's North American expansion. Your focus on data-driven content optimization and scalable partnership models aligns directly with my experience transforming traditional sports coverage into profitable digital ecosystems.

In my recent role as Executive Director at Star Tribune Media, I led the enterprise-wide sports betting platform development while pioneering a franchise concept that created $15M+ in revenue growth through strategic sponsorship partnershipsâ€”exactly the kind of commercial innovation needed to drive Better Collective's affiliate and partnership strategy. Additionally, I presented comprehensive AI strategic plans that transformed content operations, impacting over 1,000 employees. This experience directly mirrors the scale of content optimization and performance enhancement your North American sports media initiatives require. My ability to translate complex data insights into actionable content strategies has been essential in building sustainable revenue streams while maintaining editorial integrity.

Your requirement for someone who can scale content operations while driving commercial success resonates strongly with my career trajectory in sports media innovation. I have successfully built high-performing teams of 55+ professionals while developing AI-enhanced content frameworks that optimize both audience engagement and partnership value. My upcoming participation in MIT's AI & Data Science Program further demonstrates my commitment to staying at the forefront of data-driven sports media innovation. I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my combination of sports betting expertise, content monetization success, and AI-enhanced strategy capabilities can accelerate Better Collective's North American market penetration.

**Sincerely,**
