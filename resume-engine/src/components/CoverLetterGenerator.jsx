The intersection of AI innovation and thought leadership is where transformative business value is created. Your ${role} position represents exactly the kind of opportunity where my unique combination of technical AI expertise, executive communication skills, and proven revenue generation can drive meaningful impact.

At Star Tribune Media, I didn't just develop AI strategiesâ€”I evangelized them across a 1,000+ employee organization. My comprehensive AI strategic plan led to our first enterprise AI Task Force and the implementation of automation solutions that reclaimed 2.5 work-years annually. This experience taught me that successful AI adoption requires more than technical knowledge; it demands the ability to translate complex capabilities into compelling business narratives.

My approach to AI evangelism is grounded in three core principles: ethical implementation, measurable business impact, and human-AI collaboration. I've developed The CW Standard framework specifically to address the gap between AI potential and practical deployment. This methodology has proven effective in helping organizations navigate the complex landscape of AI adoption while maintaining focus on sustainable business outcomes.

What sets me apart is my ability to bridge technical depth with executive-level strategic thinking. I've generated $20M+ in new revenue through innovative frameworks and strategic initiatives, demonstrating that AI implementation must deliver tangible business results. My cross-domain pattern recognition allows me to identify applications and opportunities that others might miss.

I'm particularly drawn to ${company} because of your leadership in experience management and innovation. The opportunity to help evangelize AI solutions that enhance human experiences while driving business growth aligns perfectly with my passion for technology that amplifies human potential rather than replacing it.

I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my proven track record in AI strategy, thought leadership, and revenue generation can contribute to ${company}'s continued innovation and market leadership.

Sincerely,
Derek Simmons
