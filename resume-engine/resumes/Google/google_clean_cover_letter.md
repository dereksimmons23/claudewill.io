Go-to-Market Operations Hiring Team
Global Product Lead, Support Tools, AI
Chicago, IL

Dear Google Hiring Team,

The opportunity to serve as Global Product Lead for Support Tools, AI represents the intersection of my experience in enterprise AI implementation and systematic product development. Over the past 15+ years, I have specialized in translating ambiguous business requirements into scalable solutions that generate measurable impact—exactly the tactical direction and pragmatic execution your Global Business Applied AI team requires.

My recent focus has been developing systematic methodologies for complex AI implementation challenges. At Star Tribune Media, I led comprehensive AI strategy across a 1,000+ employee organization, developing $5M+ revenue opportunity proposals through solutions like SalesGPT automation designed to reclaim 2.5 work-years annually. This experience required the same cross-functional coordination your role demands—partnering with technical teams, business stakeholders, and executive leadership to drive enterprise-wide transformation planning.

What distinguishes my approach is the application of pattern recognition and systems thinking to product challenges that lack clear precedent. Since launching Claude Wisdom Strategies, I have developed frameworks for systematic decision-making and AI optimization that solve problems through repeatable methodologies rather than intuitive approaches. For example, my ATS Decoder research achieved 60-point algorithmic compatibility improvements by identifying and addressing systematic biases in automated systems—precisely the investigative mindset your team values.

The cross-industry perspective I bring complements Google's innovation culture. My experience implementing AI across media, consulting, and product development provides insights into how support tools can be optimized across diverse user contexts. At Star Tribune, I successfully influenced stakeholders at the executive level to align on AI implementation priorities while arbitrating technical decisions across departments—experience that translates directly to your requirement for stakeholder alignment and change management leadership.

Google's vision of technology-first workflows leveraging the best of AI aligns perfectly with my professional trajectory. My documented expertise in building business tools ecosystems, combined with enterprise-scale project management and strategic product development, positions me to contribute immediately to your Support Tools initiative. The systematic approaches I have developed for complex organizational challenges would enhance Google's efforts to simplify Ads products and elevate customer experience through data-driven improvements.

I am particularly drawn to Google's commitment to building transformational tooling that empowers teams to deliver exceptional results. My experience developing frameworks that translate business needs into scalable solutions, combined with my openness to relocating to Chicago for this role, makes this opportunity an ideal strategic alignment for both immediate contribution and long-term impact.

I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my systematic approach to AI product strategy can contribute to Google's continued innovation in support tools and customer experience optimization.

Sincerely,

Derek Simmons
