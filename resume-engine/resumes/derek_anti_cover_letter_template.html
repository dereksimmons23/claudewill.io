        <div class="content">
            <div class="paragraph">
                <strong>Immediate Differentiation:</strong> No AI could generate "I used to have a really well paying job, and I need a new one." That's human vulnerability that algorithms can't replicate.
            </div>
            
            <div class="paragraph">
                <strong>Authentic Voice:</strong> Instead of corporate buzzwords, it uses conversational language that reveals actual personality and experience.
            </div>
            
            <div class="paragraph">
                <strong>Strategic Honesty:</strong> Acknowledging professional setbacks while demonstrating resilience and clarity about what you want next.
            </div>
            
            <div class="paragraph">
                <strong>Mission Alignment:</strong> Rather than claiming passion for every company's mission, it articulates your personal driving philosophy that hiring managers can evaluate for genuine fit.

        <div class="section-title">The Company-Specific Paragraph Strategy</div>
        <div class="content">
            <div class="paragraph">
                The reality is the company name doesn't really matter. What matters are the people running it, the mission, the vision, the values. Your paragraph should reflect genuine observation about what they're actually trying to build.
            </div>
            
            <div class="framework">
                <div class="framework-title">Example Approaches:</div>
                <div>
                    <strong>For Google:</strong> "I can see you're trying to figure out how to make AI tools that actually help people get work done instead of just adding more complexity."<br><br>
                    <strong>For Anthropic:</strong> "Looking at your Constitutional AI work, I can tell you're wrestling with the same questions I've been researching: how do you build AI that's powerful enough to be helpful but principled enough to be trusted?"<br><br>
                    <strong>For any company:</strong> "Looking at what you're building, it seems like you need someone who's comfortable with chaos and can help teams figure out what actually works vs. what sounds good in meetings."

        <div class="section-title">Implementation Guidelines</div>
        <div class="content">
            <div class="paragraph">
                <strong>Customize Your Story:</strong> Replace the specific timeframe and experiences with your own authentic professional journey. The structure works, but the details must be genuinely yours.
            </div>
            
            <div class="paragraph">
                <strong>Research Before Writing:</strong> Spend time understanding what the company actually does vs. their marketing messaging. Your company paragraph should reflect real insight, not surface-level enthusiasm.
            </div>
            
            <div class="paragraph">
                <strong>Maintain Professional Boundaries:</strong> Be authentic without oversharing. The goal is to differentiate yourself through genuine voice, not therapy session details.
            </div>
            
            <div class="paragraph">
                <strong>Test Your Authenticity:</strong> If you could imagine an AI writing your cover letter, rewrite it. The test is simple: Could a algorithm replicate this, or does it require having lived your specific experience?

    <div class="section">
        <div class="section-title">The Mike and Tina Principle</div>
        <div class="content">
            <div class="paragraph">
                In the TV show "The Bear," Mike hires Tina after a five-minute conversation. When she offers her resume, he says, "Why the fuck would I want your resume? I just talked to you."
            </div>
            
            <div class="paragraph">
                That's what this template achieves. Instead of listing qualifications, it creates a conversation. Instead of keyword optimization, it reveals who you actually are and what drives you.
            </div>
            
            <div class="paragraph">
                The best hiring happens when people recognize authentic capability and character, not when they check boxes on a requirements list.

        <strong>Why This Exists:</strong> While 50%+ of job applicants now use AI to write cover letters that all sound identical, this template cannot be replicated by algorithms because it requires having actually lived through professional ups and downs.

        <div class="section-title">The Problem with Traditional Cover Letters</div>
        <div class="content">
            <div class="paragraph">
                Traditional cover letters have become generic AI-generated marketing copy. Hiring managers can spot the telltale signs: "delve into," "pivotal," "leverage synergies." These letters optimize for keywords rather than human connection.
            </div>
            
            <div class="paragraph">
                The result? A sea of identical applications where everyone claims to be "passionate about the mission" and "excited to contribute." Hiring managers are drowning in polished mediocrity, desperately searching for authentic human voices.

                <strong>Hello. My name is Derek. I like to build things. I used to have a really well paying job, and I need a new one.</strong>
            </div>
            
            <div class="paragraph">
                I could tell you about my "core competencies" and "stakeholder alignment experience," but you can read that boring shit on my resume. What you can't read is that I just went through the most transformative year of my life between April 2024 and July 2025.
            </div>
            
            <div class="paragraph">
                A lot of what I thought was really important turned out not to be. People I trusted turned out not to be trustworthy. I learned some hard lessons about institutions and loyalty and what actually matters.
            </div>
            
            <div class="paragraph">
                But here's what I didn't lose: my gratitude. My curiosity about what we can build next. And more than anything, I really love being part of a team that's trying to create something meaningful.
            </div>
            
            <div class="paragraph">
                I've spent 27 years building things in media. I've led teams through chaos, met impossible deadlines, and figured out how to innovate when everything was falling apart around us. I know what it feels like to have your back against the wall and still deliver something you're proud of.
            </div>
            
            <div class="paragraph">
                What I want now is to keep trying to solve problems. To bounce out of bed in the morning wanting to work rather than needing to work. To surround myself with people way smarter than me, sprinting to keep up, failing a lot, getting a few hits, going to bed exhausted each night knowing I've done everything I could.
            </div>
            
            <div class="customization-note">
                [Company-Specific Paragraph: Insert authentic observations about what this specific company is building and why it aligns with your actual values - not their marketing copy, but what you can see they're really trying to solve]

            <div class="paragraph">
                That's what I'm looking for. Not just a job. A place where I can keep building things that matter.
