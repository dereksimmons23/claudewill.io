This research demonstrates exactly the methodology you need for legal research and litigation workflow transformation — I've already proven I can lead customer research with experienced practitioners to understand workflows and refine product concepts.

**Proven AI Product Strategy for Complex Systems**: My 2,500+ hours orchestrating 5+ concurrent AI platforms for enterprise deployment provides the technical depth needed to partner with TR data scientists and engineers bringing new solutions to market quickly. At Star Tribune Media, I generated $5M+ in AI product revenue by systematically breaking down organizational workflows and implementing cutting-edge AI solutions across complex stakeholder environments.

**Team Leadership for AI-Savvy Professionals**: I've successfully led cross-functional teams of 55+ professionals through systematic AI transformation initiatives, directly paralleling your need to lead a team of AI-savvy lawyers. My Walking Compass research series documents proven methodologies for human-AI collaboration in professional services environments — exactly the leadership approach needed for legal technology innovation.
