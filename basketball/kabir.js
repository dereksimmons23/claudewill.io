        leftHand: "Kabir, remember - Chris Paul was equally good with both hands. That's you! Focus on the one-leg shooting in Get 50 for balance. Keep that wide base, spin low and quick. Your left hand is getting stronger every day. Next shot goes in. Always.",
        
        shooting: "High and soft, Kabir. Three basketballs fit through the rim when you shoot with proper arc. Don't let the rim be an extra defender. Aim small, miss small. Hold your finish and pose for the camera. You got this!",
        
        spinMove: "Protect that ball like a running back, Kabir! Multiple points of contact when you spin. Spin low, fast, and use their leverage against them. Don't let anyone pop it loose. Wide base, stay strong through contact.",
        
        mentalGame: "Your inner voice is your champion of success. You're not training alone - you're training in front of a packed arena. See the crowd, the teammates. Expect greatness from yourself. Champions are made when no one is watching.",
        
        fatigue: "Do you think the Top 10 incoming freshmen get tired? Push through, Kabir. This is where mental toughness is built. Energy flows from your voice - be loud, stay moving. Impossible to stand still and be loud.",
        
        motivation: "You're already SO much better than when we started in May! Every rep counts. Half the battle is turning awkward into a new normal. Keep getting those reps in. Neuroplasticity is building new pathways every day.",
        
        // Enhanced neurodivergent support responses
        organization: "Kabir, that's exactly why we built this app for you! Your brain works differently, and that's your superpower in basketball. Follow the same routine every session: Get 50 first, then conditioning, then free throws. Same order, every time. Champions love routine - it frees your mind to focus on getting better instead of remembering what's next.",
        
        overwhelmed: "Take a breath, Kabir. You're not behind, you're building. When your brain feels full, that means you're learning! Focus on just ONE drill at a time. Complete it, celebrate it, move to the next. The app keeps track so you don't have to. Your inner voice is your champion of success.",
        
        focus: "Kabir, your brain needs variety to stay engaged - that's not a weakness, it's how you're wired! Break your 60 minutes into 4 chunks: 15 minutes Get 50, 15 minutes conditioning, 15 minutes free throws, 15 minutes creative shooting. Move between different challenges. Your attention will stay sharp and your skills will improve faster.",
        
        distracted: "Perfect! That's your creative brain working, Kabir. But when you shoot, give that ball 100% attention for just 3 seconds: see the target, feel the form, follow through. Then your mind can wander until the next shot. Quality focus for 3 seconds beats scattered attention for 30 minutes. Aim small, miss small.",
        
        alone: "Kabir, you're not training alone - you're training in your own private gym where you can focus without distractions! Your brain actually loves this because you control the environment, the pace, the routine. Plus, solo training is where superstars are made. Every shot you take alone makes you more confident when you're with the team.",
        
        confidence: "Bad shooting days teach you more than perfect ones, Kabir! Your brain is wired to notice patterns and details - use that to figure out what felt different. Were you rushing? Tired? Different location? Champions have goldfish memory for bad shots - 10 seconds, then back to work. Next shot goes in. Always.",
        
        pressure: "Pressure is just information, Kabir. Your brain is processing everything at once - teammates, opponents, crowd, score. That's a lot! Focus on one thing: the rim. Your practice shots went in thousands of times. This shot is just another rep with people watching. Your inner voice is your champion of success.",
        
        routine: "Consistency is king, Kabir! Your brain thrives on routine, and that's exactly what builds basketball excellence. Same time, same warm-up, same progression. This isn't rigid - this is professional. Elite players have routines they follow religiously. Your brain's love for structure is your competitive advantage."

            - Working on Get 50 shooting drills (current: ${trainingData.rightHand} right, ${trainingData.leftHand} left)
            - Training solo in India for a month
            - Goals: 50/50 right hand, 45/50 left hand, 20 3-pointers in 2 min, 20 free throws in 1 min
            - Key focus areas: Left hand development, decision-making, spin moves, mental toughness
            - Has ADHD and ASD - needs clear, structured, encouraging guidance

            Kabir asks: "${question}"

            Respond as Coach D with:
            - Encouraging but specific guidance

            - 2-3 sentences maximum
            - End with motivation
